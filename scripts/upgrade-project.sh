# Solo Orchestrator — Project Upgrade Script
# https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator
#
# Upgrades a project's track, deployment type, or both.
# Handles all upgrade paths: track upgrades, deployment upgrades,
# POC-to-production, and personal-to-sponsored-POC transitions.
#
# Changelog:
# - BL-006 (2026-04-24): pre-commit gate now blocks feat: commits without
#   an active Build Loop. No migration code needed — the updated
#   scripts/process-checklist.sh and scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh are copied
#   by this script's existing behavior, so running an upgrade picks it up.
# - BL-015 (2026-04-25): pre-commit gate now blocks commits and PR creation
#   when .claude/pending-approval.json exists. New helper script
#   scripts/pending-approval.sh. CLAUDE.md template gets new bullet under
#   Construction Rules. Upgrade picks up the new scripts and template.
# - BL-016 (2026-04-25): init.sh now supports --non-interactive mode for
#   scriptable project setup (CI, UAT, AI agents). No upgrade-project.sh
#   change needed — scripts/init.sh is copied into projects but agents
#   typically invoke the framework's init.sh directly.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/upgrade-project.sh --track standard          # Track upgrade only
#   scripts/upgrade-project.sh --deployment organizational  # Deployment upgrade only
#   scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-production            # Full upgrade to production
#                                                          # (organizational POCs must have
#                                                          #  APPROVAL_LOG.md Pre-Phase-0 dates

#                                                          #  --ack-preconditions=<N1,N2,...>
#                                                          #  with --non-interactive)

# BL-099 SLICE-A: --sync-framework runs a DEDICATED same-tier refresh of the

#   • Every mutating doc write is status-checked (# BL-099-APPLY-STATUS). A write
#     that does not land is LOUD ([FAIL]), leaves the original's bytes intact, and
#     makes the whole run exit non-zero — never [OK] + exit 0.

#     .new, no .bak, no template copy, no `CLAUDE.md*` / `PROJECT_INTAKE.md*`
#     artifact of any kind (# BL-099-DOC-GUARD is the single enforcement point).
#   • --non-interactive forces the non-interactive channel for the sync's consent
#     paths too (same semantics as CI / SOIF_NONINTERACTIVE): with it, hooks need
#     --install-hooks and doc applies need --apply-doc-updates, tty or no tty.

# BL-001: refresh CDF (Development Guardrails) framework assets. Sources the

# into .claude/framework/, marks hook/gate scripts +x, and bumps the manifest
# frameworkVersion/frameworkCommit. Without this, a project that runs the
# documented upgrade stays frozen at its install-time CDF version and silently
# misses upstream fixes.
#
# Called from TWO sites so exactly one runs per path (see each call site):
#   • the --backfill-only path, before its short-circuit; and
#   • the full-upgrade asset-refresh block near the end — deliberately AFTER
#     the BL-015 pending-approval sentinel guard and the atomic section-2b
#     mutation, so a sentinel-blocked or rolled-back upgrade never touches
#     .claude/framework/ or the manifest pin.
#
# Graceful: the wrapper warns + returns 0 when the CDF clone is absent; the
# `|| print_warn` is belt-and-suspenders so a refresh hiccup can NEVER abort
# the upgrade — the CDF sync is an ADDITION, not a gate.

# scripts/pending-approval.sh, refuse to advance an irreversible mutation.
# Surfaced by 5/5 upgrade UAT agents (49, 62, 79, 82, 84): upgrade-project.sh
# was happily writing files and committing while a sentinel existed. Detection
# matches CDF 4.2.3's "existence alone suffices" semantics: a well-formed
# sentinel reflects its question/options back; a malformed one is treated as
# in-flight.
#
# Called from TWO sites — one per path — so the two paths stay in sync (single
# source of truth for detection; the two must NEVER drift). Both sites sit
# BEFORE the shared idempotent backfill block, so on EITHER path a
# sentinel-blocked run mutates nothing (BL-081 moved the full-path call ahead
# of that block; before BL-081 it ran after it and the full path mutated
# .claude/skills/ + the manifest before blocking):
#   • the --backfill-only path (BL-080), gated on `BACKFILL_ONLY = true`,
#     BEFORE its idempotent manifest/host/skills backfills and CDF asset
#     refresh; and
#   • the full-upgrade path (BL-081), gated on `BACKFILL_ONLY != true`,
#     the one-liner immediately after — BEFORE the same idempotent backfill
#     block and everything downstream (guard_not_in_framework, the atomic
#     section-2b mutation, and the full-upgrade CDF refresh).
# Both call sites are at top level (not inside a subshell), so the `exit 1`

#     the full path guarded only further down (after guard_not_in_framework),
#     AFTER this block — so a sentinel-blocked full upgrade printed
#     "[OK] Vendored skills synced…" and wrote .claude/skills/ + manifest

  # organizational/production projects. This block backfills the three

  # looked already-migrated and this block was skipped. That made an empty value
  # strictly WORSE than a missing one: it defeated the migration written for
  # exactly this, and every project born on init.sh's pre-BL-180 INTERACTIVE

# ── WRITE-STATUS CHECK (# BL-099-APPLY-STATUS) ───────────────────────────────
# The ONE status check every mutating write in _bl099_doc_apply goes through.
# Review round 2 (MAJOR-A): before this, the `cp` in BOTH the sidecar and the
# overwrite branch was UNCHECKED, and the driver invoked each doc as
# `_bl099_process_doc … || true` — which disables errexit for the whole call chain
# (bash exempts every command in an AND-OR list but the last, and that propagates
# into the function body). Net: a failed write printed [OK] and the run exited 0.
# That is this repo's canonical silent-success defect class.
#
# It takes the write's exit status AND re-reads the bytes, because neither alone
# is proof: `cp` can report success after a short write, and a `cp` that failed on
# open leaves a destination that merely LOOKS untouched.
#   $1 = exit status of the mutating command   $2 = source   $3 = destination
#
# BOTH HALVES ARE LOAD-BEARING, AND BOTH ARE NOW PINNED. Review round 3 caught the
# round-2 tests half-covering this: the two round-2 write-failure fixtures make the
# destination unwritable via `chmod`, so `cp` EXITS NON-ZERO and the `[ "$1" -eq 0 ]`
# half alone already catches them. Delete the `cmp -s` half and all 28 tests stayed
# green — the belt-and-braces byte re-read, the entire point of this function, was
# unpinned. The reachable hole it leaves is a `cp` that RETURNS 0 WITHOUT LANDING
# THE BYTES (short write, ENOSPC, a shadowed/stubbed cp on PATH, a destination that
# swallows writes): status-only would report [OK] and exit 0 for a doc that was
# never written — this repo's canonical silent-success defect class, and exactly
# what round 2 was meant to kill.
#
# The two mutation proofs are therefore complementary, and BOTH must stay:
#   • neuter the whole body (→ `return 0`)   → T-mutation-apply-status (round 2)
#   • drop ONLY the `cmp -s` half            → T-mutation-write-ok-byteread (round 3)
# The round-3 mutant is the one the round-2 suite could not see. It is killed by
# T-doc-overwrite-write-silently-fails-is-caught, which drives a stub `cp` that
# exits 0 and copies nothing — the only fixture where the byte re-read is the sole
# thing standing between the operator and a false [OK].

#   • non-interactive → the action comes ONLY from the declared CLI flag

# ── THE POST-MVP POLICY NOTICE — NOTICE-ONLY, the # BL-099-DOC-GUARD form ────
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §3.2 (the DECIDED sync
# semantics for the post-MVP track's project-owned policy file) and §3.1.
#
# WHAT IT DOES: prints one line naming policy keys the framework has learned
# that the project's file lacks. WHAT IT NEVER DOES: write. Not under any flag,
# not under any env, not as a sidecar, not as a backup, not as a template copy.
# §3.2 weighed managed-region refresh and a `.new` sidecar and rejected both —
# the file is the PROJECT's, and a silently reverted policy floor is the exact
# failure the mechanism/policy split exists to prevent. This is the strong
# precedent already in this file (# BL-099-DOC-GUARD's rendered-doc fence for
# CLAUDE.md / PROJECT_INTAKE.md), not the weaker sidecar one.
#
# It runs under --dry-run too, because a function that writes nothing has
# nothing to suppress — and running it there is a standing proof of that.
#
# ── WHY IT IS A DELEGATION AND NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION ─────────────────────────
# This script is CORE. The post-MVP track is a SEVERABLE MODULE (D1), and
# scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh forbids every core file from naming a module
# path on an executed line (§3.3 clause 2, tier T1 — NOT inline-waivable), with
# a file-level seam allowlist of cardinality EXACTLY ONE
# (scripts/process-checklist.sh; §3.3 clause 3 asserts the length and reds if it
# grows). So this arm may not source the module's policy lib, may not name its
# JSON file, and may not add itself to the allowlist. It delegates core -> core:
# it invokes the ONE seam, and the seam does the key-diff and prints the line.
#
# The residue that routing leaves is the waived line below, and it is worth
# being precise about it. Reaching the seam means naming the seam's ACTION FLAG,
# and every seam action carries the `delta-` prefix by design (§3.1: "a small,
# declared set of `--delta-*` actions"). That prefix is exactly what tier T2
# scans for. So the invocation is a genuine T2 hit — no delta-module path is
# named (T1 is clean) and the seam allowlist does not grow, but the token is
# there and the lint sees it. T2 exists WITH an inline, reason-required waiver
# for precisely this case, so the line carries one. Do not "fix" the lint by
# renaming the action to hide the prefix: that would evade the scan below the
# prefix boundary (§13-R15) and buy nothing.
# tests/test-delta-wp2-state-policy.sh::M5 strips the waiver marker and asserts
# the lint goes rc=1 — the waiver is pinned as load-bearing, not decorative.
#
# FAIL-SOFT, deliberately: an upgrade must never fail because an advisory notice
# could not be produced. A framework without the module installed, an older
# vendored seam that does not know the action — both are a silent no-op here.

# Atomic mutation block: snapshot → mutate → commit OR rollback
# ================================================================
# Audit code-upgrade-project-5: the 6 python3 heredocs below and the
# final `git commit` form a non-atomic mutation that touches 7 files.
# Pre-fix, ANY mid-run interruption (SIGINT, python3 KeyError, git
# commit failure) could leave the project half-mutated. The next run
# would re-read the partially-written phase-state.json and compute
# DEPLOYMENT_CHANGES=false, silently skipping the CLAUDE.md governance
# section and APPROVAL_LOG.md restructure — operator stuck with stale
# CLAUDE.md and forced to hand-edit phase-state.json to recover.
#
# Audit baseline §5.22 mandates "non-destructive of technical work."
#
# Fix mirrors the proven sibling pattern in scripts/reconfigure-
# project.sh:82-183 (PR #57, 8 weeks in production, no regressions):
#   1. Snapshot every potentially-mutated file into
#      .claude/upgrade-snapshots/<UTC-timestamp>/ before any write.
#   2. Install `trap _upgrade_rollback INT TERM ERR` so SIGINT, kill,
#      `set -e` ERR, or an explicit rollback call all restore state.
#   3. Clear the trap only after `git commit` succeeds.
#   4. Keep-3 retention on snapshot dirs — preserves forensic history

# Approval Log — {project_name}

This document records all governance approvals for this project. Each entry captures who approved what, when, and what evidence supports the approval. This is the auditable governance trail required by the Solo Orchestrator Enterprise Governance Framework (SOI-003-GOV, Section V).

**Instructions:** Update this log at each phase gate transition. Every approval entry must include the approver's name, role, date, method of approval, and a reference to the evidence. Do not delete or modify previous entries — append only. Git history provides tamper evidence.

> **Note:** This project was upgraded from personal to organizational deployment on {today}. Previous personal approval history is preserved in APPROVAL_LOG.md.personal-backup and in git history.

# --- Framework-helper script refresh (UAT 2026-04-25 fix C1) ---

# helpers ship in the framework (BL-009: lint-uat-scenarios.sh; BL-015:
# pending-approval.sh), existing projects can't pick them up by re-running
# init. This block syncs the post-BL-009/BL-015 helper set into the project's
# scripts/ directory. Idempotent: cp overwrites existing files identically.
#
# BL-046 (helpers.sh core/full split, 2026-06-30): existing projects have
# only scripts/lib/helpers.sh (the pre-split monolith). The refreshed
# short-lived scripts (check-versions.sh, check-updates.sh, etc.) source
# scripts/lib/helpers-core.sh directly. Without the two new sibling files
# they'd fall through to the inline fallback (which is functional but
# suboptimal) or, in a couple of scripts that hard-source without a
# fallback (check-maintenance.sh, check-phase-gate.sh, check-updates.sh,
# validate.sh, test-gate.sh, resume.sh, process-checklist.sh), they'd
# error out with "file not found." Ship the two new files before the
