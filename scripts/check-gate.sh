Usage: check-gate.sh <subcommand> [--yes]

Subcommands:
  --preflight       Dry-run: check current protection status without modifying anything.
                    Exits 0 if ready to cross Phase 1→2, non-zero if blocked.
  --repair          Re-run repo setup from last successful step (idempotent).
                    With --branch-protection-attested (or SOLO_BP_ATTESTED=1):
                    record the tier-limited branch-protection attestation
                    post-hoc (host-keyed reason; explicit only — BL-123) so a
                    project that met the free-tier 403 unattested can recover
                    without destroy-and-recreate.
  --backfill-host   Infer host from git remote URL and write to manifest.
  --setup-ci-token  RECOMMENDED. Guided end-to-end setup of the CI branch-
                    protection token (walk ISSUE-006). A workflow runner has no
                    credential to verify branch protection — the built-in
                    secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN cannot read it at all — so that one
                    gate check WARNs instead of enforcing until you finish this.
                    Walks you through creating a least-privilege fine-grained
                    PAT (Administration: Read-only, this repo only), VERIFIES it
                    can actually read protection before storing anything, sets
                    it as the Actions secret SOIF_PROTECTION_TOKEN, and confirms
                    the workflow reads it. GitHub-only.
                      --secret-name <name>  secret name
                                            (default SOIF_PROTECTION_TOKEN)
                      --token-env <VAR>     read the token from $VAR instead of
                                            prompting (scriptable opt-in)
                      --skip-verify         store without the read-protection probe
  --release-env-policy
                    Check that the release deployment ENVIRONMENT admits
                    tag deploys before you push a version tag (walk
                    ISSUE-016). Enabling GitHub Pages auto-creates a
                    `github-pages` environment whose default policy admits
                    the default branch only, so a tag-triggered release is
                    rejected before any step runs — empty step list, no
                    readable error. Exits 1 when tag deploys would be
                    rejected and prints the exact remediation.
                      --fix                 apply the policy instead of
                                            just reporting it
                      --env <name>          environment (default github-pages)
                      --tag-pattern <glob>  the tag class your release must be
                                            able to deploy (default v*). An
                                            existing policy SATISFIES it when the
                                            policy, read as a glob, matches this
                                            value — so a `v*` policy satisfies
                                            both `v*` and `v1.0.0`, while a
                                            `v1.0.0` policy does not satisfy `v*`.
                    GitHub-only; other hosts report NOT APPLICABLE (exit 0).

Flags:
  --yes, -y         Skip confirmation prompts (for non-interactive use,

#   STEPOPAQUE <l> /         a key line written with a YAML node tag or in
#   JOBOPAQUE <l>            explicit-key form — a real key this reader cannot

#                            or the workflow's `env:`
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (D-A, Karl 2026-08-09). The project-side detector in
# cmd_setup_ci_token used to read the workflow as a flat list of lines, so it
# could not see the two Actions-native ways a gate stops mattering while its
# `run:` body stays byte-perfect: `continue-on-error: true` (which grades a
# FAILED step as success) and a step-level `if: false` (a step that never runs
# cannot enforce). Both earned "The next push enforces the check". The bl147
# sibling has been step- and job-scoped since F-015 (`Cw6-strict-keys`,
# `Cw6-strict-gating`, `Cw6-strict-job`); this brings the user-facing surface up
# to the same doctrine.
#
# LOCATED BY CONTAINMENT, NOT BY NAME. bl147 can anchor on
# `- name: Governance - Phase gate check` because it is reading the ten
# templates the framework itself wrote. This faces a REAL user's ci.yml of
# unknown vintage, where the step may have been renamed or re-indented, so it
# walks up from the gate line to the enclosing sequence item, up again to the
# enclosing `steps:`, and up once more to the job id. Same reasoning
# `Cw6-strict-job` gives for locating the JOB by containment: a rename must not
# be a false red.
#
# The key column is DERIVED from the step's own first key rather than assumed to
# be eight spaces, because a four-space `steps:` sequence (YAML permits the dash
# at the same column as its key) is ordinary hand-written style and reading it
# as "no keys at all" would fail OPEN — the direction that produced this defect.
# Tabs are not handled because YAML forbids tab indentation outright.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is a structural reader, not a YAML parser: it answers
# "which lines belong to the gate step and its job" and leaves every judgement
# to the caller. Everything it cannot answer that way is reported as such —
# `STEP none` / `JOB none` for structure it cannot locate, `MERGE` for keys that
# live in an anchor, `FOLD` for a command that is assembled by the emitter
# rather than written down — and the caller fails CLOSED on all of them. That
# is the whole design: the alternative is guessing, and every defect this
# function has had was a guess that went the permissive way.

    # A TRAILING COMMENT IS NOT PART OF THE VALUE (R-CTE-5). The shipped phase
    # gate condition, and that same condition with ` # phase gate` after it, are

    # space — and refusing the second one told a correctly-wired project that
    # its own condition was not its own condition: the CRLF regression one notch
    # subtler. The same applies to the STRUCTURAL anchors, not just to values:
    # one comment on `steps:` or on the job id used to put the whole job out of
    # reach. (No apostrophe appears anywhere in this program — see the note on
    # CR/DQ/SQ above; the whole thing is one single-quoted shell string.)
    #
    # A `#` inside a QUOTED scalar is content, and eating it makes the refusal
    # quote a MANGLED condition back — the same self-refuting message the CRLF
    # fix removed. But a YAML scalar is quoted only when it OPENS with a quote:
    # inside a PLAIN scalar an apostrophe is ordinary content and the value
    # really does end at the ` #`. That is measured, not reasoned — PyYAML loads
    # `if: contains(m, SQ #skip SQ)` as the plain scalar `contains(m, SQ`. So
    # the quote state is armed at the first NON-BLANK character and nowhere
    # else; a scan that armed it anywhere read plain scalars whole, which
    # under-strips (a false RED, never a false OK, because a strip can only turn
    # a refusal into an acceptance when what remains is byte-exact an
    # allowlisted value) but is still the wrong reading.

    # TABS ARE CONTENT HERE, NEVER SEPARATION — `# D-A-RESIDUAL-TAB-SEPARATOR`.
    # YAML permits a tab inside a quoted scalar (`run: "echo a<TAB>b"` loads
    # fine, so redding it would be a false red) but PyYAML rejects every
    # tab-as-SEPARATOR spelling outright: a tab before a `#`, between a key and
    # its colon, or after the colon. Reading a tab as content keeps all of those
    # refused, which is the safe direction on files no parser here accepts. The
    # one that would matter if some parser did accept it is a tab-spaced colon

      # plus the `env:` of the WORKFLOW. Both of the outer two are inherited by
      # every step of the job, so narrowing to the step block alone would red
      # them; the `env:` of a SIBLING step, or of ANOTHER job, is inherited by
      # nothing here, which is exactly what the old file-wide substring match
      # could not tell apart.
      #
      # RECORDED RESIDUAL — `# D-A-RESIDUAL-ENV-SHADOW`. What the caller does
      # with these lines is a PRESENCE test (does `secrets.<name>` appear
      # anywhere in scope), and a presence test cannot see a SHADOW. Map the
      # secret at workflow `env:` while the gate step overrides the same variable
      # — `GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}` — and step env wins by the precedence
      # GitHub documents, so the gate runs with a token the tests in this repo
      # say cannot read branch protection, while "maps <name> into the phase-gate
      # step" is still earned. Pre-existing: the file-wide match this replaced
      # had the identical blind spot. UNFIXED because the fix is not free, and
      # the reason is SCOPE COLLAPSE, not an unknown variable name — an earlier
      # draft of this comment blamed `--token-env`, which is wrong and adversarial
      # review caught it: that flag names the local shell variable the SETUP
      # command reads the token value from, and the workflow-side name is
      # hard-coded (`_wf_print_gate_step` emits `GH_TOKEN:`), so for the
      # same-name shadow the name is right there on the outer mapping line.
      # What actually costs: this emitter deliberately UNIONS the three env
      # scopes into one stream, so nothing downstream can tell an outer binding
      # from an inner one — seeing a shadow means emitting scope-tagged lines and
      # teaching every consumer to read them. It also needs an exemption for a
      # `${{ secrets.X }}` written straight into the `run:` body, which this
      # scope deliberately accepts as a real mapping and which carries no
      # variable name to compare. A narrowing that guessed wrong would
      # red a legitimately-wired file, which is the direction this branch treats
      # as the worse one. Karl owns behaviour changes; this is recorded, and

  WHAT THIS IS FOR
    Your CI's phase-gate step verifies that branch protection on main is still
    configured. That is an AUTHENTICATED GitHub API read, and a workflow runner
    has no credential for it: Actions puts no token in a step's environment, and
    the built-in secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN CANNOT read branch protection at all —
    there is no \`administration\` key in the workflow \`permissions:\` block.
    Until you finish this, that one check WARNS on every run instead of
    enforcing. Everything else in the gate keeps blocking as normal.

  THE TOKEN YOU NEED (least privilege — read-only, one repo)
    1. Open:  https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
    2. Token name:        soif-protection-read ($owner_repo)
       Expiration:        your policy (90 days is a reasonable default)
       Repository access: "Only select repositories" -> $owner_repo
    3. Repository permissions -> Administration: **Read-only**
       That single permission is the whole requirement. Do NOT grant write.
       (A classic PAT with the \`repo\` scope also works but is far broader —
       prefer the fine-grained token.)
    4. Generate, then copy the value once.

  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
    The value is stored as the Actions secret \`$secret_name\` on $owner_repo
    and nothing else. This command then CHECKS your workflow — it must both map
    the secret into the phase-gate step as GH_TOKEN and let the gate's exit code
    decide that step — and tells you exactly what to add if either is missing.
    When both hold, the very next push re-arms the check.
    An UNSET secret evaluates to the empty string, which the gate reads as
    "no credential" — which is exactly today's warning.

  # The last links in the chain, and ALL THREE are required before this command
  # may claim the check now enforces (adversarial review R-1; third condition
  # added by D-A, Karl 2026-08-09):
  #   (a) the workflow READS the secret — a secret nothing reads is a silent
  #       no-op wearing a success message;
  #   (a2) something actually INVOKES the gate. Two independent reviewers
  #       reproduced the vacuous case: the old predicate asked only whether any
  #       line naming the gate DEVIATED from the allowlist, and a workflow with
  #       no gate line at all has no deviating line — so a ci.yml that maps the
  #       secret and runs nothing earned "The next push enforces the check".
  #       Nothing ran, so nothing enforced. The floor is now positive: at least
  #       one executable line must BE the allowlisted invocation.
  #   (b) the gate's EXIT CODE still decides the step. Generated projects
  #       scaffolded before this shipped ran the gate as
  #         bash scripts/check-phase-gate.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "…skipping"
  #       which throws the verdict away: the gate can print [FAIL] and exit 1
  #       while the step grades GREEN, and the "not found" message is a lie
  #       (the script was found; its verdict failed). Under that shape a
  #       correctly-scoped token changes NOTHING, so saying "the next push
  #       enforces" would be false.
  #
  # F-015 (Karl, 2026-08-09 — "Harden it"): this test is an ALLOWLIST. It used
  # to enumerate FORBIDDEN shapes — `\|\|[[:space:]]*(echo|true|:)` — and the
  # sibling pin in bl147 was proven by mutation to let `|| exit 0` through for
  # exactly that reason (BUG-009 confirm review, R-C1). A pipe, a trailing `&`,
  # an `if !` wrapper, an interpreter swap and a command appended after the
  # invocation all walked through it too, each earning the "the next push
  # enforces the check" claim while the verdict went in the bin. Blacklists lose
  # to creativity.
  #
  # So: an executable line naming the gate script may be the bare invocation or
  # the existence guard the emitted templates wrap it in, and NOTHING else.
  #
  # WHAT THE NORMALIZATION DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. It strips indentation, a
  # YAML sequence dash, the `run:` key of an inline scalar, and trailing blanks
  # — which is why an older project whose step is `run: bash scripts/…` on one
  # line still reads as honest. Whole-LINE comments are dropped before the
  # comparison. It does NOT follow that everything surviving the comparison is
  # execution-relevant: a TRAILING comment (`bash scripts/… # keep`) is
  # perfectly inert to bash, and this predicate rejects it anyway, because what
  # is compared is the line's exact TEXT. That is deliberate and it is the safe
  # direction — an unexpected byte on the gate line is a thing to look at, not a
  # thing to wave through — but it is a byte comparison, not an execution
  # analysis, and the comment must not pretend otherwise.
  #
  # THE FOUR RECORDED ASYMMETRIES with the bl147 sibling (Cw6-strict). That pin
  # reads the ten templates the framework itself wrote; this one reads a REAL
  # user's ci.yml of unknown vintage, so it is deliberately more tolerant in
  # four named places. Each is a decision, not an oversight — do not "align"
  # either side without re-reading why, and
  # tests/test-walk006-ci-protection-scope.sh pins all four so that "aligning"
  # them goes red rather than quiet.
  #   # D-A-PARITY-1-INLINE-RUN     bl147 freezes the step's whole `run:` body
  #     byte-for-byte and so rejects the inline `run: bash scripts/…` form.
  #     This accepts it: a project scaffolded before the block scalar shipped
  #     is honest, and telling its owner otherwise would be a false red.
  #   # D-A-PARITY-2-ABSENT-IF      bl147 requires the step's `if:` to BE the
  #     allowlisted phase-state condition; an absent `if:` is a red there.
  #     Here an absent `if:` is ACCEPTED — a step with no condition always
  #     runs, which is the safest shape there is, and pre-`if:` vintages are
  #     exactly what this surface faces. Any OTHER `if:` is still refused.
  #   # D-A-PARITY-3-STEP-KEYSET    bl147 allowlists {if, env, run} on the step.
  #     Here the allowlist is the documented run-step key set, so a user's
  #     `id:`/`shell:`/`working-directory:`/`timeout-minutes:` is not a false
  #     red. It is still an ALLOWLIST (a closed set refuses the sibling nobody
  #     has imagined); membership means only that the key is a DOCUMENTED
  #     run-step key rather than an unknown one, and it decides nothing about
  #     the key's VALUE. Two of them are then judged on their value by name:
  #     `continue-on-error` (which is inside the set only so that it produces
  #     ONE specific diagnostic instead of two vague ones) and `shell`.
  #     An earlier draft of this note claimed none of these keys "can change how
  #     the step's verdict is graded". That was false, and it is corrected here
  #     rather than deleted, because it is the sentence that let R-CTE-8 sit
  #     unnoticed: `shell` decides EXACTLY that (see the fourth condition
  #     below), and a note that reassures the next author is worse than none.
  #   # D-A-PARITY-4-NO-TRIGGER-PIN bl147 freezes the workflow's `on:` block
  #     (`Cw6-strict-trigger`). This does NOT inspect the trigger: a real user
  #     legitimately adds `workflow_dispatch`, extra branches or a merge queue,
  #     and redding those would be worse than the gap. KNOWN RESIDUAL: a
  #     workflow with no `push:` trigger at all still earns the claim, and
  #     "the next push enforces" is false for it. Recorded deliberately —
  #     D-A's decided scope is maps && invokes && !swallows.
  #
  # RECORDED RESIDUALS — known, unfixed, and deliberate. Named here rather than
  # in a report so the next reader of this code meets them, and pinned in
  # tests/test-walk006-ci-protection-scope.sh so closing one is a change with a
  # proof rather than a surprise.
  #   # D-A-RESIDUAL-HEREDOC-DATA  The `invokes` floor asks whether an
  #     executable LINE is the allowlisted invocation. A byte-exact gate line
  #     inside a heredoc (`cat > helper.sh <<'DONE' … DONE`) is DATA — written
  #     to a file, never run — and it counts, so a workflow that only WRITES the
  #     invocation earns the claim. This is the same "names on executed lines is
  #     not the same as invokes" gap CLAUDE.md records for BL-181, so it is not
  #     academic. It is unfixed because telling code from data inside a `run:`
  #     body needs a bash lexer (quoted and unquoted delimiters, `<<-`, nesting,
  #     command substitution, `#` in strings) and BL-181 is this repo's own
  #     record of a lexical approximation of "executed" being narrowed one
  #     character at a time and re-opening three times. The direction matters
  #     too: `wf_gate` feeds BOTH the floor and the deviation scan, so a heredoc
  #     skip that is one delimiter form too greedy would hide a real swallowing
  #     line — fail OPEN, the worse half. A correct fix is a lexer, and a lexer
  #     is its own change.
  #   # D-A-RESIDUAL-RUN-BODY-DISARM  The fourth condition below establishes
  #     that the step's SHELL fails fast. It does not — and this shape of
  #     scanner cannot — establish that the `run:` BODY leaves it that way. A
  #     body that reads `set +e` … `bash scripts/check-phase-gate.sh` … `exit 0`
  #     runs under the fail-fast default, carries a byte-exact invocation, and
  #     still grades a failed gate green. Every line the deviation scan reads is
  #     a line NAMING the script; arbitrary bash control flow on any other line
  #     is structurally invisible to it, and closing that needs a bash lexer —
  #     the same difficulty as # D-A-RESIDUAL-HEREDOC-DATA, for the same reason.
  #     Recorded rather than half-fixed so the OK sentence is not read as
  #     promising more than it checks. `## BL-218:` is the design-level decision
  #     that would subsume it (canonical-shape-or-refuse), and it is Karl's.
  #   # D-A-RESIDUAL-QUOTED-STEPS-KEY  A quoted `"steps":` is not read as the
  #     sequence anchor, so the job goes unlocatable and the file fails CLOSED.
  #     Left alone because the direction is safe (a false red, not a false OK)
  #     and `steps:` is structure rather than one of the keys this scan judges.
  #     Same for a flow-style step mapping (`- {name: …, run: …}`).
  #
  # THE FOURTH CONDITION — THE STEP'S SHELL HAS TO FAIL FAST (R-CTE-8, Karl
  # 2026-08-10). `maps && invokes && !swallows` all hold for a step whose `run:`
  # body is byte-perfect and whose keys are clean, and the gate can STILL be
  # graded green, because the interpreter decides what a failing command does.
  # Per GitHub's workflow syntax reference, "Exit codes and error action
  # preference": for the BUILT-IN `bash` and `sh` keywords GitHub enforces
  # fail-fast with `set -e` (bash also `-o pipefail`), and "you can override
  # these defaults by providing a custom shell template string". Under
  # `shell: bash {0}` the script runs bare — a failing
  # `bash scripts/check-phase-gate.sh` no longer ends the step, and any line
  # after it sets the exit code to 0. That is the same swallow
  # `continue-on-error: true` performs, spelled in a key that was previously
  # allowlisted and never read.
  #
  # AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A BLACKLIST — the doctrine this file already uses for the
  # step key set and F-015 uses for the invocation. The allowed set is the
  # documented keywords whose documented semantics make a failing gate fail the
  # step AND that can execute the POSIX-shell body this framework emits:
  # `bash` and `sh`. `pwsh`/`powershell` are documented fail-fast too, but for
  # PowerShell bodies — a step running this framework's `if [ ! -f … ]` body
  # under them does not run the gate at all, so it cannot be claimed as
  # enforcement either. `cmd` and `python` are neither. An ABSENT `shell:` is
  # ALLOWED and must stay allowed: it is the documented default and the shape
  # all ten shipped templates use.
  #
  # AND IT IS READ AT ALL THREE LEVELS, BY PRECEDENCE. `defaults.run.shell` at
  # job level or workflow level sets the same interpreter with no `shell:` key
  # on the step, so a step-scoped read would have shipped a condition anyone
  # could step around by moving one line up one level. Step > job defaults >
  # workflow defaults, resolved by writing the arms in that order and letting
  # the last one win, so a step key that overrides a bad default is not a false
  # red. The VALUE is compared as written, the same way `if:` and
  # `continue-on-error:` are — `shell: "bash"` is refused on its quotes. That is
  # the byte comparison this file already documents above, and the safe
  # direction; the refusal names the exact edit.
  #
  # JOB SCOPE IS PART OF !swallows, NOT A CONDITION OF ITS OWN. A job-level `if:`
  # stops the step running and a job-level `continue-on-error:` stops its
  # failure counting; both discard the verdict exactly as a step-level swallow
  # does (`Cw6-strict-job` makes the same argument one level up). At job level
  # the two keys are named explicitly rather than allowlisted as a set, because
  # a real user's job legitimately carries `needs`, `strategy`, `permissions`,
  # `container`, `outputs` and more — a job key allowlist would red almost
  # every customised workflow.
  #
  # HOST TRAP, now defused: this predicate used to depend on `grep -qvxF` over
  # EMPTY input exiting non-zero (no lines, so no non-matching line). That is
  # what /usr/bin/grep does and what runs here, but at least one dev box in this
  # project aliases interactive `grep` to ugrep, which INVERTS the empty-input
  # result — so a hand-run reproduction read backwards. The empty case is now
  # handled by an explicit `[ -n "$wf_gate" ]` guard instead of by grep's
  # empty-input convention, so the reproduction and the shipped behaviour agree.

# WALK-ISSUE-016-RELEASE-ENV-POLICY-BEGIN
# Walk 2026-08-02, ISSUE-016 (Major): the documented happy path — "release is
# triggered by version tags: git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags" — HARD-FAILS on
# a fresh GitHub Pages repo, opaquely. Enabling Pages auto-creates a
# `github-pages` deployment environment whose default branch policy admits the
# DEFAULT BRANCH ONLY, so a run triggered from a TAG is rejected by the
# environment's protection rules BEFORE any step executes: an empty step list,
# no readable error in `gh run view`, and no doc anywhere connecting the two.
#
# WHY THIS LIVES IN A SCRIPT AND NOT IN release.yml: a run that the environment
# rejects never starts a job, so an in-workflow preflight step is unreachable by
# construction. The check has to run somewhere that CAN execute — here, from the
# workstation, before the tag is pushed.
#
# Dry-run by default (report + exact commands, exit 1 when tag deploys would be
# rejected); `--fix` applies. Non-github hosts are NOT APPLICABLE, not failures:
# GitLab protected environments and Bitbucket deployment permissions are
# different mechanisms and neither auto-creates a default-branch-only policy on
# a fresh repo.
