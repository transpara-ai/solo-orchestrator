Usage: check-gate.sh <subcommand> [--yes]

Subcommands:
  --preflight       Dry-run: check current protection status without modifying anything.
                    Exits 0 if ready to cross Phase 1→2, non-zero if blocked.
  --repair          Re-run repo setup from last successful step (idempotent).
                    With --branch-protection-attested (or SOLO_BP_ATTESTED=1):
                    record the tier-limited branch-protection attestation
                    post-hoc (host-keyed reason; explicit only — BL-123) so a
                    project that met the free-tier 403 unattested can recover
                    without destroy-and-recreate.
  --backfill-host   Infer host from git remote URL and write to manifest.
  --setup-ci-token  RECOMMENDED. Guided end-to-end setup of the CI branch-
                    protection token (walk ISSUE-006). A workflow runner has no
                    credential to verify branch protection — the built-in
                    secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN cannot read it at all — so that one
                    gate check WARNs instead of enforcing until you finish this.
                    Walks you through creating a least-privilege fine-grained
                    PAT (Administration: Read-only, this repo only), VERIFIES it
                    can actually read protection before storing anything, sets
                    it as the Actions secret SOIF_PROTECTION_TOKEN, and confirms
                    the workflow reads it. GitHub-only.
                      --secret-name <name>  secret name
                                            (default SOIF_PROTECTION_TOKEN)
                      --token-env <VAR>     read the token from $VAR instead of
                                            prompting (scriptable opt-in)
                      --skip-verify         store without the read-protection probe
  --release-env-policy
                    Check that the release deployment ENVIRONMENT admits
                    tag deploys before you push a version tag (walk
                    ISSUE-016). Enabling GitHub Pages auto-creates a
                    `github-pages` environment whose default policy admits
                    the default branch only, so a tag-triggered release is
                    rejected before any step runs — empty step list, no
                    readable error. Exits 1 when tag deploys would be
                    rejected and prints the exact remediation.
                      --fix                 apply the policy instead of
                                            just reporting it
                      --env <name>          environment (default github-pages)
                      --tag-pattern <glob>  the tag class your release must be
                                            able to deploy (default v*). An
                                            existing policy SATISFIES it when the
                                            policy, read as a glob, matches this
                                            value — so a `v*` policy satisfies
                                            both `v*` and `v1.0.0`, while a
                                            `v1.0.0` policy does not satisfy `v*`.
                    GitHub-only; other hosts report NOT APPLICABLE (exit 0).

Flags:
  --yes, -y         Skip confirmation prompts (for non-interactive use,

# Actions secret, and verifies the workflow will actually read it.
#
# WHY A WALKTHROUGH AND NOT A DOC LINE: the failure mode this closes is not

  WHAT THIS IS FOR
    Your CI's phase-gate step verifies that branch protection on main is still
    configured. That is an AUTHENTICATED GitHub API read, and a workflow runner
    has no credential for it: Actions puts no token in a step's environment, and
    the built-in secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN CANNOT read branch protection at all —
    there is no \`administration\` key in the workflow \`permissions:\` block.
    Until you finish this, that one check WARNS on every run instead of
    enforcing. Everything else in the gate keeps blocking as normal.

  THE TOKEN YOU NEED (least privilege — read-only, one repo)
    1. Open:  https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
    2. Token name:        soif-protection-read ($owner_repo)
       Expiration:        your policy (90 days is a reasonable default)
       Repository access: "Only select repositories" -> $owner_repo
    3. Repository permissions -> Administration: **Read-only**
       That single permission is the whole requirement. Do NOT grant write.
       (A classic PAT with the \`repo\` scope also works but is far broader —
       prefer the fine-grained token.)
    4. Generate, then copy the value once.

  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
    The value is stored as the Actions secret \`$secret_name\` on $owner_repo
    and nothing else. This command then CHECKS your workflow — it must both map
    the secret into the phase-gate step as GH_TOKEN and let the gate's exit code
    decide that step — and tells you exactly what to add if either is missing.
    When both hold, the very next push re-arms the check.
    An UNSET secret evaluates to the empty string, which the gate reads as
    "no credential" — which is exactly today's warning.
