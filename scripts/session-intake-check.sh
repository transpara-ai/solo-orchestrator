# Solo Orchestrator — SessionStart hook for intake/Phase-0 onboarding state
# BL-202: Claude Code loads project context only when the FIRST message is
# sent, so a fresh session in a generated project dead-airs — the user does
# not know what to type, and Claude does not know the intake is unfinished.
# This hook puts that fact INTO CLAUDE'S CONTEXT on every launch surface (CLI,
# desktop, IDE) and, on a genuinely fresh conversation, ALSO seeds the first
# user turn so the screen need not stay blank at all.
#
# OUTPUT CONTRACT (BL-202 follow-up; verified against
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md, fetched 2026-07-31). When this
# hook has something to say it emits exactly ONE compact JSON document:
#   {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SessionStart",
#                          "additionalContext":"…","initialUserMessage":"…"}}
#   • additionalContext is the structured equivalent of the plain stdout this
#     hook used to print — SAME TEXT, same job: it lands in Claude's context,
#     so whatever the operator types first, the reply knows the intake state
#     and relays it. Emitted on EVERY source; that is the old behaviour,
#     preserved exactly. Multiple hooks' additionalContext is merged by Claude
#     Code, and the sibling hooks' plain stdout coexists with it.
#   • initialUserMessage seeds an actual first user turn, and so is written in
#     the OPERATOR'S voice and kept short — the heavy instructions stay in
#     additionalContext. The docs say it "appears as the first user message in
#     a new session (startup/fork only)", so on any other source the client is
#     expected to ignore it. We do not lean on that: the same request is ALSO
#     carried by additionalContext, so a client or version that drops the field
#     lands exactly on the pre-follow-up behaviour. Degradation by
#     construction, not by hope.
#   • The documented source enum is startup|resume|clear|compact|fork. We emit
#     initialUserMessage ONLY for {startup, clear}, and the gate FAILS CLOSED on
#     everything else — absent, unreadable, unparsable, or unrecognised:
#       - resume / compact are mid-conversation context refreshes;
#       - fork is withheld DELIBERATELY, and it is the interesting one: the
#         docs pair it with startup as a client-honoured source, but a fork
#         INHERITS a real conversation's history, so a synthetic "I just opened
#         this project" would talk over live context. A forked session loses
#         nothing but the auto-start — additionalContext still fires.
#       - clear is KEPT in the arms although the docs list only startup/fork as
#         client-honoured: /clear empties the conversation, so seeding it is
#         safe, and if the client ignores the field there additionalContext
#         carries the same request. Harmless either way.
#     This is deliberately the OPPOSITE default from session-test-gate-check.sh,
#     whose missing-envelope default is "startup" for legacy compatibility.
#   • Plain stdout and JSON from ONE hook is UNDEFINED, so every speaking path
#     goes through emit_state() and emits one form only. The single non-JSON
#     fallback fires when jq itself fails, i.e. before anything is written.
#   • Silence stays silence — FIVE states print NOTHING (no envelope, no empty
#     JSON), and the fifth is a fall-through that is easy to miss:
#       1. not a generated project (no phase-state.json / no PROJECT_INTAKE.md);
#       2. jq unavailable;
#       3. the operator's proceed-without-intake ack is recorded;
#       4. current_phase > 0;
#       5. Phase 0, intake filled, and PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md ALREADY PRESENT —
#          this one clears every early guard and exits at the last `if`, which
#          is exactly why the stdin read must live inside emit_state (see
#          # BL-202-LAZY-STDIN) and not at file scope.
# Fail-open is absolute: every path exits 0, and no silent path reads stdin.
#
# Detection is MODE-AGNOSTIC — the blank-table-cell count over
# PROJECT_INTAKE.md (scripts/validate.sh's predicate, >20 = incomplete).
# .claude/intake-progress.json is written by the wizard's main-menu mode 1
# ONLY, so it must never be the deciding signal (AI-assist and manual users
# would read "incomplete" forever).
#
# Standalone by design: sources nothing, so tests can run a copy from any
# directory (the R-BL203-13 lesson — an unloadable mutant proves nothing).

# + intake filled + PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md already present. An eager read at file
# scope therefore ran with nothing to say — and `cat` never sees EOF while any
# writer holds the pipe open, so a hook that was about to stay silent could
# BLOCK SessionStart indefinitely. Reading inside the speaking path makes that

INTAKE INCOMPLETE — relay this to the operator as your FIRST response, then follow it.

This project's intake (PROJECT_INTAKE.md) has ~${blank_cells} unfilled fields and Phase 0 has
not started. Offer the operator these two choices ONCE, then respect the answer:
  1. Continue the intake now — run: bash scripts/intake-wizard.sh
     (or work through PROJECT_INTAKE.md's unfilled sections together).
  2. Proceed without it — record the choice so this notice never repeats (if
     .claude/process-state.json is missing, run bash scripts/process-checklist.sh --verify-init first):
     jq '.intake.proceed_without_intake_acknowledged = true' .claude/process-state.json > .claude/process-state.json.tmp && mv .claude/process-state.json.tmp .claude/process-state.json
If the operator's first message is a real task, answer it AFTER offering this choice once —
never block their work over paperwork.
