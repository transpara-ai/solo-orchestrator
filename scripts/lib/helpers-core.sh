#
#   rc 124 on timeout, and the command's own status otherwise. run_with_timeout
#   returns 1 for a timeout, which is indistinguishable from "it ran and
#   failed" — so a caller can never report "this took too long" as itself.
#
#   A POLL FLOOR OF 0.1s, NOT 1s. run_with_timeout sleeps a whole second before
#   its first re-check, so every bounded call costs ~1s even when the command is
#   instant. That is invisible at one call site and arithmetic at forty:
#   check-versions.sh bounds a check_command AND a version_command per row, and
#   on the 21-row shipped matrix it measured 5-6s before the bound and 50-51s
#   after — inside the SessionStart hook. The bound was right; its price was
#   never measured. `sleep 0.1` is not POSIX, so a shell that rejects it falls
#   back to whole seconds rather than spinning: correctness first, speed if the
#   platform allows it.
#
#   The deadline is WALL CLOCK, not an increment count, so a SIGCHLD from some
#   other killed child — which cuts `sleep` short — cannot inflate the counter
#   and kill a command early. That bug is why scripts/resolve-tools.sh grew a
#   private copy of this in the first place; the copy is now deleted and this is
#   the one owner.
#
# run_with_timeout is deliberately UNTOUCHED — its body is byte-identical to
# main's. Changing a shared gate primitive is a separate decision from fixing a
# regression at two new call sites.
#
# Derive its reach, do not read it here. An earlier draft of this comment said
# "eleven call sites across six product files", which was true of `main` and
# false of the tree the comment shipped in: this branch's own Qdrant work added
# three more, so HEAD is 14 across 7. A count stated on the page that falsifies
# it is the failure this whole entry is named for.

#       | grep -vc 'command -v run_with_timeout'
#   done
# THE BOUND IS ON THE PROCESS, NOT ON THE PIPELINE, AND A CALLER CAN DEFEAT IT.
# `kill -9` reaps the `bash -c` child; a pipeline's OTHER members survive it and
# keep the write end of any pipe open. So a caller that consumes the output
# through a COMMAND SUBSTITUTION — `v=$(run_with_deadline 2 bash -c 'sleep 12 |
# cat')` — blocks for the full 12s while this function returns in 2, because the
# substitution reads until the last writer closes, not until the child dies.
# Measured: plain `sleep 12` returns at the bound; `sleep 12 | cat`, `(sleep 12)`
# and the shipped Colima row's `… | head -1 | awk …` all ran to completion.
# 21 of the 41 checkable matrix rows are that shape.
#
# Callers must therefore redirect to a FILE and read it afterwards, which is
# what `_cv_version_bounded` (check-versions.sh) and `run_bounded_capture`
# (resolve-tools.sh) do. Both are measured at the bound for every shape.
# `set -m` + `kill -- -$pid` was tried first and does NOT work here: a command

# Refuse to operate as a project if cwd OR an explicit target directory is

# (verify-install.sh, process-checklist.sh, upgrade-project.sh,
# intake-wizard.sh, pending-approval.sh, reconfigure-project.sh) must call
# this BEFORE any file writes.
#
# Keep the phrase "Every project-targeted script" and the parenthesized list
# exactly where they are: tests/test-platform-security-bugs-closer.sh::T4b
# anchors an awk scan on that phrase and stops at the first `)`.
#
# init.sh used to be on that list and is NOT any more — BL-199, 2026-07-29.
# What remains is six scripts / eight call sites (measured 2026-07-29 with
# `grep -rn guard_not_in_framework --include='*.sh' scripts/`; upgrade-project.sh
# accounts for three of them, and pending-approval.sh also defines a no-op
# fallback of the same name, which is a definition, not a call).
# It is the one script here that does not operate on the cwd: it CREATES a
# target directory. Running it from inside the clone is the documented Quick
# Start, so it calls guard_target_not_in_framework (below) instead, which
# checks the target and ignores the cwd. The list above is parity-pinned by
# tests/test-platform-security-bugs-closer.sh::T4b — every basename inside
# those parentheses must have a real call site, so do not re-add init.sh to
# it without restoring the call.
#
# Usage:
#   guard_not_in_framework               # checks $(pwd) only (legacy / default)
#   guard_not_in_framework "$target_dir" # checks $(pwd) AND "$target_dir"
#
# The optional target-dir argument was added for security-audits-1
# (S3, 2026-04-26 audit sweep): init.sh accepts --project-dir=PATH and
# proceeds to write into PATH even if PATH is the framework repo. The
# cwd-only check missed that vector because the cwd could be a benign
# tempdir while --project-dir pointed at the framework. Callers that
# accept any "write into this dir" arg (init.sh, upgrade-project.sh, ...)
# MUST pass it as $1 so this guard can lint both surfaces.
#
# UAT 2026-04-25 fix (U-N + U-O): a UAT agent's cwd was the framework dir
# (instead of their tempdir), so verify-install.sh + indirectly CDF init
# scattered .claude/, .claude-backup/, gates/, hooks/, rules/, and
# APPROVAL_LOG.md into the framework root. None tracked, but contaminates
# the workspace and can sneak into commits.
#
# Detection signature: the framework has a top-level init.sh whose header
# contains "Solo Orchestrator — Project Initialization Script" — a string
# that's specific to this framework and won't appear in arbitrary projects'
# init.sh files. Also check for templates/generated/ to triple-confirm.
#
# BL-199 (2026-07-29): the signature probe was hoisted OUT of
# guard_not_in_framework into the top-level _soif_dir_is_framework below, so
# guard_target_not_in_framework can reuse it without first having to call
# guard_not_in_framework (bash only publishes a nested function definition
# after the enclosing function has actually run). guard_not_in_framework's

# ── BL-199: run-from-the-clone support ───────────────────────────────────
#
# Why these exist (2026-07-29). README § Quick Start has always said
# `git clone` → `cd solo-orchestrator` → `./init.sh`, but guard_not_in_framework's
# FIRST arm is an unconditional cwd check, so from inside the clone init.sh
# refused before any prompt — even with --project-dir pointing at a benign
# external path (measured rc=1). Only --dry-run worked. Karl's decision:
#
#   1. Running init.sh FROM INSIDE the clone is the SUPPORTED flow.
#   2. It must still FAIL when the operation would write ONTO the framework
#      itself: target == framework root, target INSIDE the framework tree,
#      or target is another framework clone (signature match).
#   3. `./init.sh --project-dir <bare-name>` creates the project ONE LEVEL UP
#      from the framework clone.
#
# These are NEW functions. guard_not_in_framework keeps its cwd-first
# contract for its six other scripts / eight call sites (verify-install.sh,
# reconfigure-project.sh, upgrade-project.sh ×3, pending-approval.sh,
# process-checklist.sh, intake-wizard.sh) — those genuinely operate ON the
# cwd project and must still refuse inside the framework. Only init.sh, which
# operates on a TARGET it is about to create, moves to the target-only guard.

# Resolve a user-supplied project directory to the path init.sh will write.
#   soif_resolve_target_dir <raw> <anchor_parent>
#
#   • empty <raw>        → empty (interactive flow resolves later via prompt)
#   • absolute <raw>     → returned UNCHANGED. This is the back-compat hinge:
#                          every pre-BL-199 caller and test passes an absolute
#                          --project-dir, and it also makes the resolver
#                          idempotent, so the three call sites in init.sh can
#                          each apply it without compounding.
#   • relative <raw>     → "<anchor_parent>/<raw>", then lexically normalized.
#
# The anchor is the PARENT OF THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING init.sh (SCRIPT_DIR/..),
# never the cwd — Karl's worked example invokes init.sh by full path:
#   /x/solo-orchestrator/init.sh --project-dir testproject  →  /x/testproject/
# Anchoring on the cwd would put the project wherever the operator happened to
# be standing, which is exactly the surprise this change exists to remove.
#
# Normalization is LEXICAL and bash-3.2-safe (no realpath, no GNU-only flags):
# `.` segments are dropped and `seg/..` pairs collapse. Symlinks are NOT
# resolved here — guard_target_not_in_framework physicalizes separately, so a
# `..` escape through a symlink still cannot smuggle a write into the framework.

# Device+inode identity of a directory, as "dev:ino"; empty on any failure.
#
# Why identity and not string comparison (R-199-1, 2026-07-29 adversarial
# review). macOS APFS is case-INSENSITIVE by default and `pwd -P` resolves
# symlinks but does NOT canonicalize case, so `<x>/solo-orchestrator` and
# `<x>/SOLO-ORCHESTRATOR` stay distinct STRINGS naming the SAME directory. The
# byte-wise prefix match below therefore missed them, and the reviewer took it
# end-to-end: `--project-dir "$TMP/CLONE/injected"` with the clone at
# `$TMP/clone` scaffolded 400 files INSIDE the framework, rc=0, no refusal.
# dev+inode is spelling-agnostic by construction and demonstrably covers
# symlinks (pinned by T10 + M5). It SHOULD also cover hardlinked directories
# and bind mounts, since those are the same identity by definition — but that
# is a deduction, not a measurement: unprivileged directory hardlinks are
# refused on both platforms and macOS has no bind mounts, so no test in this
# repo reaches either. Stated as a deduction on purpose; do not cite it as
# tested.
#
# NOT a `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` comparison: on a genuinely case-SENSITIVE
# filesystem `/x/FOO` and `/x/foo` are different directories, and lowercasing
# would false-REFUSE a legitimate target. Identity is correct on both kinds of
# filesystem; case-folding is correct on neither.
#
# The `cd … && pwd -P` step matters: `stat` does not dereference a symlink
# argument on either GNU or BSD, so stat'ing a symlinked directory would return
# the LINK's inode. Resolving first makes the id the real directory's.

#
# Three arms, each independently load-bearing and each pinned by exactly one
# test shape in tests/test-bl199-quickstart-from-clone.sh:
#   (a) the target IS *a* framework clone (signature match) — the
#       security-audits-1 S3 vector, preserved verbatim: a caller supplying
#       --project-dir=$SOME_OTHER_FRAMEWORK_CLONE from a benign cwd.
#       Isolated by T8, whose target is a SECOND, different clone: neither (b)
#       nor (c) can see it, so disabling (a) turns T8 red.
#   (b) the target IS *this* framework's root. Isolated by T7, whose fixture is
#       a framework root with templates/generated deliberately absent — that
#       kills (a) for the fixture, and (c) starts at the target's PARENT and so
#       never matches the target itself. Disabling (b) turns T7 red.
#   (c) the target is INSIDE this framework's tree. This arm is NEW — the old
#       cwd-based guard never had it: with the cwd check gone, a subdirectory
#       target (`--project-dir "$FRAMEWORK/sub"`) would otherwise scaffold a
#       whole project into the framework checkout. Measured on the pre-fix tree
#       from a benign cwd: rc=0, project created inside the repo. Isolated by
#       T3, and by T9/T10 for the identity half specifically.
#
# Each of (b) and (c) is evaluated THREE ways, cheapest first: the as-given
# string, the symlink-resolved (`pwd -P`) string, and finally device+inode
# identity. The string passes are a fast path only — identity is the one that
# is actually correct, because two different spellings can name one directory
# (case-insensitive filesystems, symlinks, bind mounts). See _bl199_dir_id for
# the measured bypass that forced this (R-199-1).
#
# NOTE ON REDUNDANCY, so a reader does not mistake it for coverage. THREE of
# the four string comparisons in (b) and (c) are strict subsets of the identity
# checks beside them: deleting one alone changes no observable behaviour and no
# test notices. That is deliberate over-determination on the cheap path.
#
# The FOURTH is not, and the first version of this comment wrongly said it was
# (caught in review, 2026-07-29). `_bl199_path_is_inside "$abs_target"
# "$fw_root"` — the AS-GIVEN comparison in arm (c) — uniquely catches a symlink
# that lives INSIDE the framework and points OUTSIDE it:
#     ln -s /somewhere/else "$FW/escape";  --project-dir "$FW/escape/proj"
# Identity says "outside" (the bytes really do land elsewhere) and the
# physicalized string agrees, so removing this atom flips that target from
# REFUSE to allow. Measured. T12 pins it and M7 proves it.
#
# DECISION — that target is REFUSED, deliberately (2026-07-29). Physically
# nothing would be written into the framework, so allowing it would not break
# the no-contamination invariant. It is refused anyway because:
#   • the contract is stated over the path the OPERATOR SUPPLIES — "not the
#     clone, not anything inside it" — and `$FW/escape/proj` is inside it by
#     the only reading a user can perform without resolving symlinks;
#   • otherwise whether a target is accepted would depend on what symlinks
#     happen to exist in the framework tree, i.e. on framework contents rather
#     than on operator input. That is unpredictable and would silently change
#     as the tree changes;
#   • an operator who genuinely wants that destination can pass its real
#     absolute path, which is allowed and clearer.
# Refusal is the conservative side of a genuine ambiguity, and it is now
# pinned rather than emergent.
#
# The behaviour each ARM owns is what the T7/T8/T3 shapes pin.

# Verify the calling process can create files at $1.
#
# Why this exists (BL-041 closer, 2026-06-30):
#   init.sh historically only learned that the target directory was
#   unwritable AFTER hundreds of lines of setup — by which point it had
#   already side-effected logs, mkdir'd partial scaffolds, and bailed in
#   the middle of an inconsistent install. Worse, the framework-repo
#   guard (guard_not_in_framework above) used to fire BEFORE any write-
#   permission check, so test harnesses running from inside the
#   framework checkout could not exercise the read-only failure path
#   at all (tests/edge-cases-pre-init.sh E8b was SKIPped).
#
#   This preflight is the operator-facing write-permission probe. It
#   MUST run before guard_not_in_framework so that:
#     • a real operator who points --project-dir at an unwritable
#       location gets a clear permission error (not the developer-
#       facing framework-repo refusal that is irrelevant to them);
#     • test harnesses running from any cwd can deliberately exercise
#       the read-only assertion without first being short-circuited
#       by the framework-repo guard.
#
# Contract:
#   • returns 0 if the target can be created/written; 1 otherwise.
#   • empty $1 returns 0 (caller has no resolvable target yet — interactive
#     flows resolve via prompts after this preflight; the project_dir-
#     existence check downstream handles that path).
#   • when target does not exist, the deepest existing ancestor is probed.
#   • emits a self-contained operator-facing error on failure (no caller
#     post-message needed).
