# scripts/lib/scout/scout-reality.sh — §8.2's `reality` section: the five
# read-only probes, plus the derived rollup.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §8.2 (the `reality`
# object and the extraction table row naming process-checklist.sh's
# `verify_init()` as the source).
#
# M5: sources nothing. See scripts/lib/scout/scout-core.sh's header.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT WAS EXTRACTED, AND WHAT WAS DELETED IN THE COPY
#
# The original is `verify_init()` in `scripts/process-checklist.sh`. It is a
# WRITER: its first statement is `ensure_state_file`, and every passing probe
# appends its own name to `.phase2_init.steps_completed` in
# `.claude/process-state.json`. The final arm writes `phase2_init.verified` and
# raises `current_phase`.
#
# NONE OF THAT IS HERE, and the deletion is the point of the file rather than a
# detail of it. §3.1's promise is that the scanner writes NOTHING outside its
# own report path. A survey that mutates the thing being surveyed is not a
# survey, and — worse — it would be writing FRAMEWORK state into a project that
# has not agreed to adopt the framework. The writes are removed, not guarded:
# there is no flag that turns them back on, because a flag is a thing that gets
# set. The proof is tests/test-brownfield-wp1-scout.sh R1/R2, which hash the
# entire fixture before and after; X2 re-introduces an ensure_state_file-shaped
# write and requires those cases to go red.
#
# THE FIVE PROBES §8.2 NAMES, and the two it disposes of:
#
#   remote_repo_created         `git remote get-url origin` — read-only as-is.
#   branch_protection_configured  ALWAYS `unknown`. See below.
#   ci_pipeline_configured      widened past the original's exact `ci.yml`.
#   project_scaffolded          the original's lockfile list, unchanged.
#   pre_commit_hooks_installed  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` executable, unchanged.
#   branch_protection: see the marker.
#   data_model_applied          NOT probeable. Omitted with a reason, never
#                               faked — the original cannot auto-verify it
#                               either and says so to the operator.
#
# WHY branch_protection_configured IS ALWAYS `unknown`.
#   The original verifies it for real, through the host dispatcher, against the
#   host's API. A read-only survey tool must not make authenticated API calls
#   on the operator's behalf: the operator asked it to look at a directory, and
#   nothing about that request licenses spending their credentials on a remote
#   they may not even have chosen yet. `unknown` is the honest answer and the
#   `how` string carries the reason, so a later reader cannot mistake the blank
#   for "not configured". Worth noting that the original does not always reach
#   the host either — its `# BL-126-ATTEST-CONSULT-BEGIN` fence short-circuits
#   on a recorded tier-limited attestation — but that attestation lives in
#   framework state a brownfield project does not have.
#
# THE ROLLUP is `initialization_verified` in the original: an auto-complete arm
# that fires when every prerequisite step is done. Here it is a derived, written
# -nowhere summary. It can never read `pass`, because one probe is permanently
# `unknown` — and that is the correct result rather than a defect to paper
# over. The scanner genuinely does not know whether this project's phase-2
# initialization is complete, and saying so is what it is for.

# _scout_probe WORK NAME RESULT HOW — append one probe row.
_scout_probe() {
  printf '%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$2" "$3" "$4" >> "$1/probes"
}

# scout_reality_probes ROOT WORK — fills $WORK with the reality section's data.
#
# Writes (all inside WORK, which the entry script owns and removes):
#   probes  `<name>\t<pass|fail|unknown>\t<how>` in §8.2's order
#   rollup  `<result>\t<passed>\t<total>\t<how>`
#
# READ-ONLY. Every statement below is a test, a read or a printf. Nothing here
# creates, truncates, moves or chmods anything under ROOT.
