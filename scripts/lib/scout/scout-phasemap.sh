# scripts/lib/scout/scout-phasemap.sh — §8.2's `phaseMap` section: the
# extracted artifact ladder.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §4.4 (the ladder and
# its THREE corrections), §8.2 (the `phaseMap` object and the extraction table
# row naming validate.sh as the source).
#
# M5: sources nothing. See scripts/lib/scout/scout-core.sh's header.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT WAS EXTRACTED, AND FROM WHERE
#
# The original is `scripts/validate.sh`, in the straight-line top-level script
# body under `print_section "Phase State & Artifacts"`, where a variable named
# `artifact_phase` is assigned by a run of four independent `if [ -f … ]`
# tests: PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md -> 1, PROJECT_BIBLE.md -> 2, a non-empty
# docs/test-results/ -> 3, HANDOFF.md -> 4.
#
# §8.2 specifies reuse-by-EXTRACTION: the PREDICATE is copied, the dependency
# is not. Nothing here sources validate.sh, and validate.sh is unchanged — it
# is a diagnostic for framework-native projects and it is correct at that job.
# What follows is a DECISION PROCEDURE for a project the framework has never
# seen, and §4.4 names three corrections it has to make.
#
# CORRECTION 1 — a function, and a marker.
#   The original is not in a function and carries no marker, so it cannot be
#   cited, called or mutation-tested. The extracted copy is `scout_phasemap_scan`
#   and its load-bearing line is `# SCOUT-LADDER-MAX`.
#
# CORRECTION 2 — maximum reached rung, not last-wins.
#   The original's assignments are sequential, so the LAST matching test wins.
#   A project with a HANDOFF.md and a since-emptied docs/test-results/ reports
#   4 — it is credited with a phase it demonstrably skipped. The extracted copy
#   CLIMBS: a rung advances the placement only when the rung below it was
#   itself reached, so the ladder stops at the first gap. That fixture reports
#   2 here, and X1 in tests/test-brownfield-wp1-scout.sh restores last-wins and
#   watches 2 become 4.
#
#   The report carries BOTH numbers, on purpose. `suggestedPhase` is where the
#   ladder stops; `highestSatisfiedRung` is the highest rung satisfied in
#   isolation. When they differ, the gap between them IS the finding — this
#   project has phase-4 artifacts and no phase-3 evidence — and hiding it
#   behind one number would throw away the most useful thing the scan learned.
#   §8.2's `note` is emitted verbatim.
#
# CORRECTION 3 — the adoptee's own evidence.
#   The original keys on four framework filenames, which a brownfield project
#   does not have; applied unchanged it would place every adoptee at 0. Each
#   rung is re-expressed over what the project actually has — a product
#   description of any name, an architecture document of any name, a test
#   corpus that runs, a lane out the door — with the framework filename kept as
#   ONE input among several. §4.4 calls this the least certain mechanism in the
#   design and §12 says so; the mitigation is that every rung publishes the
#   evidence string it decided on, so the operator can disagree with a specific
#   claim rather than with a number.
#
# THE FLOOR RULE (§4.4), which is why being wrong here is survivable: the
# interview may only move the placement DOWN. This is a ceiling offered for
# argument, never a floor asserted over the operator.

# _scout_rung3 ROOT WORK — is there a test corpus that actually runs?
#
# "That runs" is the phrase §4.4 uses and it is doing real work: a `tests/`
# directory with no way to invoke it is a folder, not a corpus. Rung 3 needs
# BOTH a corpus and a command — or the framework's own archive of results,
# which is proof the corpus ran at least once.
#
# EVERY "is there content here" question on this ladder goes through
# `scout_dir_has_entries`, which counts NON-HIDDEN entries. A `.gitkeep` is not
# an archived test result. Read that function's header before replacing any of
# these calls with an inline emptiness test — the last time the predicate and
# the count were spelled separately, this arm reported a satisfied rung and
# "0 archived result files" in the same breath, and the design's own scenario
# regressed to the number correction 2 exists to remove.
