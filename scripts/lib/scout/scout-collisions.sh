# scripts/lib/scout/scout-collisions.sh — §8.2's `collisions` section: what the
# adoptee already has that the framework's writers would land on, each sorted
# into one of §7.1's four buckets. REPORT-ONLY. Scout still writes nothing.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §1.2 (the measured
# collision surface — this file's inventory is that table), §7.1 (the four
# buckets, and the vocabulary is reused rather than reinvented), §7.2 (the
# archived-hook description), §7.3 (the archive's own secret hazard), §7.4 (the
# CI carve-out and its four SDLC-undermining detector rules), §7.5 (project
# files: keep theirs), §8.2 (the schema).
#
# M5: sources nothing. See scripts/lib/scout/scout-core.sh's header.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE INVENTORY IS THE DESIGN'S TABLE, NOT A GUESS. §1.2 read every write in
# the scaffolder from its write primitive — `cat >` / `cp` / `printf >` versus
# a marker-guarded `>>` — so the behaviour-on-a-pre-existing-file column is
# measured, not inferred. This file reports which of those surfaces the target
# actually HAS. A surface that is absent produces NO ROW: "we looked and there
# is nothing there" is expressed by the row not existing, never by a row saying
# so, because a reader counting rows must be counting real collisions.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# CONTENT IS NEVER QUOTED INTO THE REPORT, AND THAT IS THE SAME RULE AS §6.2.
#
# Two surfaces here would naively want to quote bytes, and both are refused:
#
#   THE HOOK DESCRIPTION. §7.2 requires a what-it-invokes description for every
#   archived git hook, and §7.3 names the hazard in as many words — the archive
#   promotes an untracked `.git/hooks/` file into version control, and a
#   hand-rolled hook can contain a token. So the description is assembled from
#   a FIXED TOOL VOCABULARY: the generator emits names it recognises and
#   nothing else. A hook line reading `export AWS_KEY=…` contributes exactly
#   nothing, because no allowlisted token matches it. It is advisory and says
#   so — a hook can do anything, and this is a summary, not a specification.
#
#   THE CI FINDINGS. A workflow line can carry a credential just as easily as a
#   hook line. Each finding therefore reports the RULE, the PATH and the LINE
#   NUMBER — enough to open the file at the right place — and never the matched
#   text. §6.2's doctrine, applied to a surface §6.2 does not mention.

# ── The four buckets (§7.1), spelled once ───────────────────────────────────
# archive-and-replace  their AI-layer surfaces and their git hooks: inventory,
#                      archive with a MANIFEST, install the clean set, disclose
#                      plainly, permit recorded re-adds
# marker-composed      where the framework already composes by marker-fenced
#                      append, with an uninstall
# audit-only           their pipelines: never archived, never touched (§7.4)
# keep-theirs          project files; the framework's artifacts adapt (§7.5)

# _scout_col_add WORK PATH CLASS BUCKET DESC NOTE FINDINGS — one inventory row.
#
# AN EMPTY COLUMN IS WRITTEN AS `-`, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. Tab is an IFS
# WHITESPACE character, so `IFS=$'\t' read -r a b c` collapses a run of tabs
# into ONE delimiter even when IFS was set explicitly — a row with an empty
# middle field silently shifts every column after it into the wrong variable.
# Measured here: the CI rows' empty description put the note into `description`
# and the rule list into `note`, and the report emitted `findings: []` for a
# workflow that had a finding. The reader turns `-` back into an empty string.

# _scout_hook_vocabulary — the tool names a hook description may contain.
#
# A CLOSED LIST IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM. Anything a hook invokes that is not on
# this list is reported as "and other commands" rather than named, which costs
# a little fidelity and buys the guarantee that no byte of a hook can reach the
# report through this path. Adding a row here is a deliberate act with a
# readable diff; that is the intended cost.
