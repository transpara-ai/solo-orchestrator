#
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the git-hook bodies init.sh installs and
# scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework refreshes (BL-099 SLICE-A). Both
# callers source this lib so a hook the operator installed at scaffold time and
# a hook the sync refreshes are generated from identical bytes — no drift.
#
# Contents:
#   • SOIF_PRECOMMIT_OPEN / _CLOSE — markers wrapping the managed region of the
#     fallback pre-commit hook (added by BL-099; shebang stays line 1).
#   • SOIF_TDD_OPEN / _CLOSE — markers wrapping the BL-072 TDD-ordering block in
#     the commit-msg hook (pre-existing markers, hoisted here as constants).
#   • soif_lang_test_pattern <language> — the init.sh language→test-file-pattern
#     table; empty for languages with no distinct test-file convention (rust,
#     unknown). BL-142: this is NOT an install gate — since BL-107-UNIVERSAL-
#     INSTALL, init.sh and the sync install the commit-msg TDD hook for EVERY
#     language; an empty pattern only means the gate classifies test evidence
#     by content/convention (rust's inline #[test] probe, generic conventions
#     for unknown) instead of by filename.
#   • soif_write_precommit_hook <file> — writes the full fallback pre-commit hook
#     (shebang + managed region between markers).
#   • soif_tdd_region_body / soif_emit_tdd_commitmsg_block — the commit-msg
#     TDD-gate managed block (region = markers+body; block = leading blank +
#     region, the exact bytes init.sh appended pre-refactor).
#
# BL-194-HOOK-SEMGREP-POLICY — the anchor that `tests/test-bl147-ci-template-
# integrity.sh` derives the CI-template semgrep policy from. It sits immediately
# above the `semgrep scan` invocation inside the emitted hook; the suite starts
# collecting at the anchor, skips the anchor's own comment lines, joins the
# line-continuations, and asserts the collected text contains `semgrep scan` —
# so the flags are never retyped and a drifted anchor fails loudly instead of
# deriving an empty policy.
#   WHY AN ANCHOR AND NOT THE COMMAND NAME. The collector used to scope on a bare
#   `/semgrep scan/` over the whole file with no comment stripping, so the first
#   line MENTIONING the command won — and `# BL-112-MAX-TARGET-BYTES` documents
#   the invocation in prose above it, carrying a FALSIFIER that necessarily names
#   the command. The suite then graded 22 correct CI templates against an empty
#   policy and reported a config-parity break that did not exist.
#   THE ANCHOR IS SAFE TO NAME IN A COMMENT — including on this very line. The
#   collector tries EVERY occurrence in file order, skips the comment lines that
#   follow each one, and accepts an occurrence only if the text it collects
#   contains `semgrep scan`; a mention inside a comment block therefore resolves
#   to nothing and is passed over. Pinned by `Cg-derive-decoy-marker-first`.
#   IT IS NOT SAFE ANYWHERE — that claim was refuted. The marker inside a STRING
#   (not a comment) sitting above some other `semgrep scan` DOES resolve, as does
#   a stale anchor+invocation pair left by a refactor. Neither is caught by
#   try-every, because the derivation then succeeds on the wrong text. What
#   catches both is requiring EXACTLY ONE resolving occurrence
#   (`# BL-194-DERIVE-UNAMBIGUOUS`), which turns them into one loud,
#   correctly-attributed failure. Do not replace the try-every loop with a
#   first-match or last-match scan (each is forgeable from one end), and do not
#   drop the exactly-one count.
#   ONLY THE ONE-LINE MARKER BELONGS INSIDE THE HEREDOC. This rationale is
#   framework-side deliberately: everything between `cat <<'HOOKEOF'` and
#   `HOOKEOF` is written verbatim into every generated project's
#   `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, where a path like `tests/test-bl147-…` does not
#   exist and this discussion is noise to the operator reading their own hook.
#
# BL-112 (E2E walk findings F8 + F9) — the two load-bearing lines in the EMITTED
# pre-commit hook, both carrying a grep-able marker:
#   • # BL-112-SAST-ERROR   — semgrep needs `--error` or it exits 0 ON FINDINGS,
#     which made the [BLOCKED] arm dead code (an eval(req.query.code) Express RCE
#     was detected, printed, and committed clean). `--severity=ERROR` bounds the
#     gate to high-confidence findings so it stays passable.
#   • # BL-112-STRICT-GATE  — the region's terminal exit is CONDITIONAL, because
#     install-filesystem-gates.sh appends the BL-030 strict-gate block BELOW this
#     region; an unconditional `exit $FAILED` made that block unreachable.
#   • # BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN  — the ONE behaviour for "the scanner did not run",
#     shared by the tool-ABSENT arm and the tool-FAILED (rc>=2) arm: WARN loudly,
#     never block, and never let a not-run scan look like a clean scan. The rc=0
#     arm prints an [OK] receipt for the same reason (a silent pass is
#     indistinguishable from an absent gate — the BL-112 defect class itself).
# NOTE: nothing emitted into the hook may contain the literal marker text of
# either managed block ("SOIF pre-commit fallback" / "SOIF framework gate") —
# installers and tests grep for those strings, and a comment that mentions one is
# indistinguishable from the block itself. Describe them; do not quote them.
# tests/test-bl112-commit-enforcement.sh pins both lines against a REAL scaffold
# and a REAL `git commit`; tests/test-bl099-guard-coverage.sh carries them as
# registry rows.
#
# bash-3.2 safe. Pure emitters — no project-state reads, no network.

# fence), so an emitter-level excision of the helper body and an in-hook grep
# never collide. Do NOT quote those marker strings in prose here: the mutation
# suites range-delete them, and a comment that reproduces the literal marker is
# indistinguishable from the marker itself. Quoting: LEDGEREOF is single-quoted so the body is

# --- SAST Quick Scan (Semgrep) ---
# BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN — "the scanner did not run" has exactly ONE meaning and ONE
# behaviour here, whatever the cause (tool ABSENT, or tool PRESENT but FAILING):
# WARN LOUDLY, never block. Both arms below call this, and both are pinned by
# tests/test-bl112-commit-enforcement.sh in BOTH directions.
#
# WHY NOT BLOCK ON A TOOL FAILURE (the tempting answer, and the wrong one):
#   • It buys NO security. Anyone who can break the scanner can instead take the
#     strictly easier semgrep-ABSENT path (uninstall it, or shadow it on PATH),
#     which WARNs by documented contract — or simply delete this hook, which is
#     not version-controlled and needs no privileges at all. Blocking one of two
#     equivalent doors, in a room with no walls, is theatre.
#   • It is worse than theatre: it would make BREAKING the scanner strictly more
#     costly than REMOVING it, i.e. it pays people to uninstall the scanner.
#   • And it costs plenty. `p/owasp-top-ten` is a REGISTRY ruleset that semgrep
#     fetches from semgrep.dev with no local-cache fallback, so a developer who
#     is offline / proxied / rate-limited gets rc=2 on EVERY commit. A gate you
#     cannot pass is a gate people --no-verify around — the exact culture BL-112
#     exists to end.
# The attested boundary for "the scanner could not run" is PHASE 3
# (run-phase3-validation.sh + the 3->4 gate), where BL-113 made an un-run scan
# unlaunderable and its skip attested and recorded. This hook is the fast local
# tripwire, not the ledger. What it owes the operator is HONESTY: it must never
# let a not-run scan look like a clean scan.

# dishonesty, and this arm's whole job is to describe reality. It carries the SAME

# for that string — still sees the loud signal. Like the helper above it WARNs and
# never blocks: an entry we could not read is not evidence of a defect, and blocking

# BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE — THE RECEIPT IS AN ATTESTATION, SO IT MUST BE EARNED END-TO-END.
# The two guards above cover the entries the materialization loop could not READ. This
# one covers the step AFTER that: semgrep is handed N materialized targets and may
# silently DECLINE some of them. Its documented default `--max-target-bytes` is
# 1,000,000, and an oversize target is dropped with NO error, rc still 0 — so before
# this guard the arm printed `[OK] semgrep: SAST ran on N staged file(s)` counting a
# file semgrep never opened (R-274R-1: 900,037 staged bytes -> REFUSED; the SAME
# content padded to 1,100,032 -> COMMITTED with the [OK] receipt and the innerHTML sink
# in HEAD). That was the FIFTH member of this arm's silent-success class (gitlink,
# `<stage>:` path syntax, PATH_MAX, rename, size) and the FIRST to emit a POSITIVE
# FALSE ATTESTATION rather than merely losing coverage.
#   SO THE FLAG IS NOT THE FIX. `--max-target-bytes=0` retires the size TRIGGER; this
#   guard covers the STEP, by refusing to say [OK] unless semgrep itself reports that it
#   took every target we handed it and parsed every line of what it took.
# WHAT THIS GUARD DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE — STATE IT NARROWLY. IT HAS BEEN OVERSTATED
# ONCE ALREADY, AND THE UNDERSTATEMENT COST A SECOND FALSE ATTESTATION. An earlier
# revision of this comment claimed "per-rule skips, parse-time drops and whatever the next
# semgrep release adds are all covered by construction, with no sixth patch." That was
# FALSE and was caught in review (R-274Rv-1). The counter it read is a TARGET-SELECTION
# counter — it answers "did semgrep take the file", never "did semgrep understand the
# file" — so a target semgrep accepted and then failed to PARSE satisfied it completely
# and collected the full [OK] attestation.
#   THIS ARM SHIPS TWO OF THE FOUR STAGES, AND SAYS SO. Between "a staged entry" and "a
#   rule finished matching" there are four stages: rule-set RESOLUTION, target SELECTION,
#   PARSE/decode, and RULE EXECUTION. This guard reads semgrep's own banner for SELECTION
#   (soif_sg_accepted) and for RULE EXECUTION (soif_sg_timeouts, # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE).
#   It does NOT cover PARSE — see THE STAGE THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER below,
#   which is BL-192 — and it does not cover RULE-SET RESOLUTION. Neither gap is described
#   as closed anywhere in this arm, and the [OK] receipt's precondition list at the bottom
#   of this arm enumerates FOUR preconditions, not five, for exactly that reason.
# THE NUMBERS, AND WHY THESE AND NOT THE OTHERS. Semgrep's banner carries several counts
# and they measure different stages.
#   • The Scan Status header `Scanning N files with M Code rules:` means "targets that
#     survived semgrep's own target FILTERING". It is fixed by target filtering alone, so
#     it is independent of WHICH rules the live registry happened to resolve — measured
#     2-of-2 for `app.ts + README.md`, 1-of-2 for `app.ts + <oversize>.js`, and 2-of-2 for
#     that same pair once --max-target-bytes=0 is passed. USED — it is the SELECTION half
#     of the invariant (soif_sg_accepted).
#   • `Targets scanned: N` is the plausible-looking alternative and it is REGISTRY-
#     DEPENDENT, which is the reason it is not used. It counts targets whose LANGUAGE
#     matched a rule, so what it reports depends on the resolved ruleset rather than on
#     this commit. With the three --config sets this arm passes it currently agrees with
#     the header on every shape measured (`app.ts + README.md` -> 2, `README.md` alone
#     -> 1, `package.json` alone -> 1) because the resolved set contains `<multilang>`
#     rules that apply to every target regardless of language — semgrep's own table prints
#     `<multilang>  3 rules  2 files`. Drop or change one --config and that stops being
#     true without anything in this arm changing, and the guard would start NOTRUNning
#     ordinary commits — the cry-wolf failure BL-112 exists to end. RULED OUT for being a
#     fact about the registry rather than a fact about this commit.
#     (AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS BULLET CLAIMED IT READS 1-of-2 FOR `app.ts + README.md`
#     AND 0 FOR `README.md` ALONE. Both were REFUTED by measurement in review, R-274Rv2-5;
#     the argument above is the one the probe actually supports.)
#   • `Parsed lines: ~N%` is the only number in the banner that reports PARSE loss, and it
#     WAS the second clause of this guard. IT IS NOT USED, AND THE REMOVAL IS THE POINT —
#     the number stopped being trustworthy upstream. See THE STAGE THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY
#     DOES NOT COVER below (BL-192). Do NOT re-add a clause reading it without re-measuring
#     the instrument first; the clause was correct and the instrument was not.
#   • `Warning: N timeout error(s) in <target> when running the following rules: [...]`
#     reports a rule which started and did not finish. USED — it is the RULE-EXECUTION
#     half (# BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE). Note the shape difference and do not paper over it:
#     the header is a NUMBER parsed and compared, this one is a NAMED STRING whose
#     ABSENCE is the good case. That makes it a trigger detector rather than a proof, and
#     the difference is the residue tracked as BL-187.
#     IT IS NOT THE ONLY LINE CARRYING THE ATOM, and an earlier revision of this bullet
#     said it was (R-772-4). Once --timeout-threshold trips, semgrep also prints
#     `Semgrep stopped running rules on <target> after N timeout error(s).` — which is why
#     soif_sg_timeouts is a count of LINES rather than of timeouts, why the operator text
#     says "warning line(s)", and why the threshold path is COVERED rather than missed.
#     See the rejected-narrowing note on soif_sast_scan_coverage_report before touching it.
#   • `Rules run: N` was checked and is NOT a discriminator: the timed-out run reports
#     `Rules run: 29` exactly like a clean one, because a rule that started counts as run.
# FAIL CLOSED, ALWAYS — AND THE RULE-EXECUTION FACT IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, SAID OUT LOUD.
# If the NUMERIC line is missing, duplicated or unparseable — an older or newer semgrep, a
# future output redesign — soif_sg_accepted stays EMPTY and the arm takes the loud NOTRUN
# path. It must never fall through to [OK]: a parser that cannot read the receipt's
# evidence and prints the receipt anyway IS the silent-success class, wearing the coat of
# the code that was supposed to end it. The cost of that choice is real and is accepted
# deliberately: on a host where that header never appears, EVERY commit reports NOT
# ENFORCED. That is loud, honest and non-blocking (this arm never blocks on a can't-scan),
# and it is strictly better than a receipt nobody can trust.
#   THE TIMEOUT CHECK CANNOT HAVE THAT SHAPE AND THIS COMMENT WILL NOT PRETEND IT DOES.
#   Its good case is the line's ABSENCE, so "absent => fail closed" would NOTRUN every
#   commit ever made. It is therefore a POSITIVE DETECTOR for a spelling semgrep emits
#   today, verified on 1.157.0, and a future release that renames the warning re-opens
#   exactly the hole R-274Rv2-1 found — silently. That is a real asymmetry between the
#   two facts, it is not fixable from the default banner (semgrep exposes per-rule
#   timing only under --time/--json, which this arm does not use), and it is filed as
#   BL-187 rather than described as closed. Anchor on the atom `timeout error(s)` and
#   NOT on the whole sentence: semgrep WRAPS that warning across two lines at ~120
#   columns even when stderr is a file, so matching the full "…when running the following
#   rules:" phrase would fail on the wrap.
# THE STAGE THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER — PARSE/DECODE, FILED AS BL-192.
# A `Parsed lines: ~N%` clause SHIPPED IN AN EARLIER REVISION of this work and was PULLED
# BEFORE MERGE, on measurement. It is recorded here rather than quietly omitted, because
# the next reader will otherwise re-derive it and re-ship it.
#   WHAT THE CLAUSE DID. It read `Parsed lines: ~N%` back and forfeited the receipt on
#   anything short of ~100.0%. On semgrep 1.157.0 that WORKED for the trigger it was built
#   for: an ordinary TypeScript file saved as UTF-16LE with a BOM (a Windows editor
#   default, 142 bytes) carrying `pane.innerHTML = userText` read `~85.7%`, forfeited the
#   receipt, and its byte-identical UTF-8 control was REFUSED outright.
#   WHY IT IS NOT HERE. On semgrep >= 1.171.0 the SAME fixture reads `Parsed lines:
#   ~100.0%` for a file semgrep never decoded, then reports ZERO findings on content that
#   contains the sink. The banner's SPELLING did not change — the VALUE became
#   untrustworthy — so the clause is not merely fragile, it is BLIND, and it grants [OK]
#   over an unscanned sink. A clause that reads a number which no longer means what it
#   says is worse than no clause: it is a guard-shaped object, and shipping one is how the
#   BL-112 class survives a fix.
#   `--json` IS NOT THE ESCAPE. It affirmatively reports both files as scanned and nothing
#   as skipped, so it is strictly worse evidence than the banner. `--x-ls-long` does expose
#   skip reasons and is documented by upstream as unstable — an unstable interface cannot
#   carry a gate.
#   THE OPEN DESIGN QUESTION, STATED SO IT IS NOT LOST: a parse/decode guard must VERIFY
#   THE DECODE ITSELF rather than trust semgrep's self-report. That is BL-192, and it is
#   the reason this arm's precondition list is four items long and not five.
# THE RESIDUE, NAMED — AND THE EXACT LIMIT OF WHAT THIS GUARD SEES.
#   • A staged file semgrep ACCEPTS AND DOES NOT DECODE — UTF-16 with or without a BOM,
#     embedded NUL bytes, a 40KB binary blob staged as `vendor.js`, and a HARD TOKEN-STREAM
#     BREAK in an otherwise ordinary source file: NOT CAUGHT. All report the full target
#     count in the Scan Status header and zero findings. This is the BL-192 stage above.
#     Note the token-stream break in particular — it is not an exotic encoding, and it is
#     DETERMINISTIC: measured on 1.157.0 (R-772-2) on a two-line fixture,
#     `export function r(p){ p.innerHTML = window.name; }` followed by
#     `function ((( broken $$$`, at this arm's exact flags and DEFAULT verbosity:
#     `Parsed lines: ~100.0%`, rc=0, `Findings: 0`, 5 of 5 identical runs — while the SAME
#     sink alone in a well-formed file is rc=1 and BLOCKED. semgrep's parsers are
#     error-recovering and a recovered parse reports no loss, so even the withdrawn clause
#     never saw this one.
#     A SIGNAL DOES EXIST, ONE FLAG AWAY, AND IT IS RECORDED HERE SO THE NEXT READER DOES
#     NOT RE-DERIVE IT. The same fixture under `--verbose` prints
#     `[WARN] Syntax error at line <target>:N`, and that string is a real discriminator:
#     count 1 on the broken file, count 0 on the clean control. ANCHOR ON THAT AND NOTHING
#     ELSE. `Partially analyzed due to parsing or internal Semgrep errors` looks like the
#     better phrase and is NOT one — measured, it is a section HEADER semgrep prints on
#     EVERY verbose scan (count 1 on the clean control too); what changes is the bullet
#     beneath it, ` • <none>` versus ` • brokensink.ts`. Anchoring on the header would
#     NOTRUN every commit — the cry-wolf failure BL-112 exists to end — which is why the
#     specificity control belongs on the atom and not on the paragraph around it.
#     THE FLAG IS NOT ADDED HERE, DELIBERATELY. Turning `--verbose` on for every commit is
#     a change to the shipped invocation and a real cost: it is the one path where stderr
#     is surfaced verbatim to the operator. Whether that trade is worth a deterministic
#     parse-break detector is a POLICY call and it belongs to BL-192.
#   • A PER-RULE TIMEOUT ON A DENSE >1MB SOURCE FILE: NOW CAUGHT, by
#     # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE, which is why this row reads differently from the one above.
#     It is not an exotic encoding — it is a file `tsc` compiles happily. Measured through
#     the shipped emitter on 1.157.0, sink on line 2 of an otherwise ordinary
#     generated-looking .ts, padding that is CODE rather than comments: 196,561 and 600,561
#     bytes -> REFUSED [BLOCKED]; 1,216,567 bytes -> COMMITTED with the full `[OK]` receipt
#     and the sink in HEAD, DETERMINISTICALLY (5/5), BEFORE this clause existed. semgrep
#     printed `Scanning 1 file`, `Targets scanned: 1`, `Parsed lines: ~100.0%`,
#     `✅ Scan completed successfully.` and rc=0 — every selection fact read COMPLETE —
#     plus one line the selection clause does not read: `Warning: 1 timeout error(s) in
#     …heavy.ts when running the following rules:
#     [javascript.browser.security.insecure-document-method…]`.
#     THE PADDING SHAPE IS THE WHOLE POINT: the same sink under >1MB of COMMENT padding
#     (1,253,093 bytes) is BLOCKED, because comments are cheap to match. A fixture that
#     pads with comments is the one large-file shape that structurally cannot provoke this,
#     which is exactly how the first revision of this guard shipped believing it was safe.
#   • A --config ID THAT RESOLVES TO ZERO RULES: NEVER caught, by EITHER fact, because it
#     is a stage neither of them is about — RULE-SET RESOLUTION, which happens BEFORE
#     selection. Measured on 1.157.0 at this arm's exact flag set: a retired registry id
#     (`r/javascript.browser.security.this-rule-was-retired`) passed ALONGSIDE a working
#     `p/owasp-top-ten` — so the registry is PROVABLY REACHABLE and this is not a
#     network-fallback artefact — gives rc=0, `Scanning 1 file with 173 Code rules`,
#     `Findings: 0`, `Rules run: 28`, `Targets scanned: 1` and ZERO lines matching
#     error/warning/`not found`/`unknown`/`invalid`. The control with the real id is rc=1
#     and BLOCKED at 174 rules / 29 run. Every fact this arm reads says COMPLETE, and it is
#     telling the truth: semgrep really did select and finish everything — with a ruleset
#     that silently lost the rules that catch the sink. The TRIGGER IS UPSTREAM REGISTRY
#     DRIFT, not operator error: the id is a literal in # BL-118-DOMXSS-CONFIG and it stops
#     resolving the day the registry retires or renames it, with no commit to this repo.
#     Note the numbers assume ALL THREE --config lines; drop one and they shift.
# So: this guard closes the >1MB-selection trigger and the per-rule-timeout trigger, and
# does not touch the rest. It is a third and a fourth precondition, not a closure. The
# remainder is BL-192 (parse/decode — and the INSTRUMENT for it, which is why the clause
# that used to sit here was withdrawn) and BL-187 (rule execution), and the phrase "covered
# by construction" does not belong anywhere near this arm — it is what an earlier revision
# claimed and it was false.
#
# THREE WARN HELPERS NOW, NOT ONE, AND THE SPLIT IS DELIBERATE — same reasoning
# soif_sast_partial_coverage records for ITS split from soif_sast_not_enforced. Saying
# "nothing was scanned" when a subset WAS scanned is a small dishonesty; so is saying
# "these entries were never scanned" when what we actually know is "one of these was".
# All three carry the SAME "SAST NOT ENFORCED" vocabulary, so every operator habit and
# every test that greps for that string still sees the loud signal, and all three WARN
# without blocking — a target the scanner declined is not evidence of a defect, and
# blocking on it would pay people to route around the gate (rationale above). The two
# lines that differ are parameters here rather than a fourth copy of the helper.

  # NO PARSE-COVERAGE LINE HERE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS A DECISION, NOT AN OMISSION. A
  # `Parse coverage: semgrep reports it parsed N% …` line shipped in an earlier revision,
  # reading semgrep's `Parsed lines: ~N%`. It was withdrawn with the clause that produced
  # it: on semgrep >= 1.171.0 that percentage reads ~100.0% for a file semgrep never
  # decoded, so printing it would tell the operator a reassuring number that is not about
  # their file. Reporting nothing is honest; reporting a number that no longer means what
  # it says is the BL-112 dishonesty in operator prose. See # BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE above
  # and BL-192.
  # # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE — the SECOND fact, and a different one. Selection is which
  # targets semgrep took; this is whether the rules then FINISHED running against them.
  # Both are printed on every forfeited receipt, always, even when only one of them is the
  # reason: an operator told "coverage was partial" who then fixes the wrong half
  # re-commits straight back into the other.
  #   AND IT IS THE ONE GAP THIS ARM CAN ATTRIBUTE PER FILE. Semgrep's default output does
  #   not say which target it DECLINED (hence the "all of them are listed" hedge below),
  #   but the timeout warning names the target AND the exact rule ids. Surfacing it is
  #   strictly the # BL-182-NAME-THE-ENTRY contract being honoured where it can be.
  #   THE NUMBER IS LINES, AND THE SENTENCE NOW SAYS SO (R-772-4). soif_sg_timeouts is a
  #   `grep -c` over the atom `timeout error(s)`, i.e. a count of LINES CARRYING THE ATOM,
  #   and semgrep emits TWO such lines for ONE timeout once --timeout-threshold trips:
  #   `Warning: 1 timeout error(s) in heavy.ts when running the following rules: …` and
  #   `Semgrep stopped running rules on heavy.ts after 1 timeout error(s).` At the shipped
  #   defaults (--timeout=5, --timeout-threshold=3) the second line is reachable with no
  #   flag change, so the old word "warning(s)" over-reported by up to 2x. The VERDICT was
  #   never affected — it is `-eq 0`, and any non-zero count forfeits the receipt — so this
  #   was a labelling defect only, and it is fixed by labelling, not by counting.
  #   NARROWING THE COUNT WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED; DO NOT "FIX" THIS BY NARROWING IT.
  #   The alternative was a second variable counting only `Warning: [0-9]+ timeout error\(s\)`
  #   for the message while soif_sg_timeouts kept the broad atom for the verdict. Three
  #   reasons against. (1) It is the shape this arm rejects everywhere else: `MATCH THE
  #   ATOM, NOT THE SENTENCE` on # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE exists because every extra token in
  #   a named-string detector is another upstream-rename cliff, and BL-187 is open PRECISELY
  #   because this fact is already the fragile one of the three. (2) It buys nothing the
  #   verdict uses — the number is operator prose, and "N lines mention a timeout" is a true
  #   sentence a reader can act on. (3) It could not be PROVED to this repo's standard: the
  #   watched-RED case a narrowing owes is "the threshold-skip line arrives WITHOUT the
  #   Warning line, and the verdict still fires", and provoking a threshold trip needs three
  #   real timeouts on one target — host-speed-dependent, which is why the existing
  #   T-mutation-rule-timeout already carries an explicit SKIP arm for a host whose semgrep
  #   finishes the rule inside its budget (it PASSES on this host; the arm exists because it
  #   cannot be relied on to). A guard whose proof can only skip on some hosts is not a
  #   guard. The wording fix owes no test; only the two strings below moved,
  #   and T-rule-timeout-names-the-rule's guard in tests/test-bl132-sast-index-scan.sh was
  #   moved with them so it keeps EXERCISING rather than silently skipping.

  # NAMED, not counted — the # BL-182-NAME-THE-ENTRY contract. Semgrep's DEFAULT output

  # is surfaced verbatim). So this names the exact set that was handed over and says
  # plainly that attribution stops there, rather than implying a precision it does not
  # have, and it points the operator at the one invocation that CAN attribute.
  #   AN EARLIER REVISION ENDED THIS FUNCTION WITH A BOUNDED `/Scan skipped/` awk EXCERPT
  #   AND A SENTENCE PROMISING THAT "semgrep's own skip summary follows and usually
  #   identifies the entry outright". BOTH WERE REMOVED (R-772-3) — but state the reason
  #   as a MECHANISM, not a universal, because the universal is false and was itself
  #   refuted in review:
  #     `Scan skipped:` is semgrep's target-DISCOVERY report. This arm ships
  #     `--max-target-bytes=0` (# BL-112-MAX-TARGET-BYTES), which disables the only skip
  #     reason its explicit-file invocation can hit, so the section cannot appear AS
  #     INVOKED. FALSIFIER, run it rather than trusting this — and note its PRECONDITION,
  #     without which it does not fire at all: stage a target LARGER THAN 1 MB, strip that
  #     flag, and the same run prints ` • Scan skipped:` /
  #     `   ◦ Files larger than  files 1.0 MB: 1`. On an ordinary sub-1MB commit, stripping
  #     the flag changes nothing (`Targets scanned: 1` either way) — a reader who tries it
  #     there sees no difference and wrongly concludes this claim is unverifiable. A
  #     directory target plus `.semgrepignore` reaches it by a second route. So the old
  #     excerpt was dead ONLY because of what this arm passes — not because semgrep never
  #     emits it.
  #   UPSTREAM'S 0.85.0 RELEASE NOTE IS TRUE — IT JUST DOES NOT REACH THIS ARM'S TARGETS,
  #   AND THE CAUSE IS TARGET POSITION, NOT A VERSION DEFECT. The note reads "Explicitly
  #   targeted files are now unaffected by global filters such as include/exclude patterns
  #   and file size limits, and `.semgrepignore` patterns also do not affect them".
  #   AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS PARAGRAPH CALLED THE SIZE HALF "FALSE ON THE PINNED
  #   VERSION". THAT IS REFUTED — it generalised from a single OUT-OF-PROJECT probe. The
  #   exemption is scoped to targets INSIDE the scan's PROJECT ROOT; a target outside that
  #   root is an ordinary global-filter subject, size cap included.
  #   MEASURED, semgrep 1.157.0, ONE 2,506,065-byte .ts, cwd = the git repo in ALL FOUR
  #   rows, this arm's exact --config set. `hdr` is the scan-status line the parse below
  #   greps for; `skipped` counts lines matching `Scan skipped`:
  #     relative path, INSIDE repo               rc=1  hdr=`Scanning 1 file …`   skipped=0
  #     absolute path, INSIDE repo               rc=1  hdr=`Scanning 1 file …`   skipped=0
  #     absolute path, OUTSIDE repo              rc=0  hdr=`Scanning 0 files …`  skipped=1
  #     absolute OUTSIDE + --max-target-bytes=0  rc=1  hdr=`Scanning 1 file …`   skipped=0
  #   Row 3 is the only one that loses the file: `Targets scanned: 0` plus ` • Scan
  #   skipped:` / `   ◦ Files larger than  files 1.0 MB: 1`. Deterministic, 3 of 3.
  #   THE HEADER IS STILL EMITTED IN ROW 3, AND THAT DECIDES WHICH NOTRUN FIRES. It reads
  #   `Scanning 0 files with N Code rules:` — the parse below MATCHES that, so
  #   soif_sg_accepted is "0" and not empty, and the receipt is forfeited on the COUNT
  #   COMPARISON rather than on the fail-closed unreadable-header path. Do not record this
  #   row as "no header"; that names the wrong arm.
  #   THE BOUNDARY IS THE PROJECT ROOT, NOT THE SPELLING OF THE PATH. Rows 1 and 2 agree,
  #   so absolute-versus-relative is not the variable. Re-measured with cwd swapped: a
  #   target inside a NON-git cwd is SCANNED, and a target inside a git work-tree reached
  #   from a cwd outside it is SKIPPED. The root is cwd, widened to its enclosing git
  #   work-tree where there is one.
  #   THE PATTERN HALF HOLDS IN BOTH POSITIONS — RE-MEASURED, NOT RESTATED. An `--exclude=`
  #   match and a `.semgrepignore` match are both scanned anyway (`Targets scanned: 1`)
  #   whether the target is in-project or out of it. The asymmetry is SIZE-ONLY.
  #   SO WHY THE FLAG IS STILL LOAD-BEARING AS SHIPPED. # BL-132-INDEX-SCAN materializes
  #   every staged blob into a `mktemp -d` tree and hands semgrep ABSOLUTE paths under it.
  #   That tree is OUTSIDE the project root, so EVERY target this arm scans is row 3 —
  #   global filters DO apply, and without `--max-target-bytes=0` a >1MB staged blob is
  #   dropped silently (R-274R-1). The flag is right; the reason recorded here for two
  #   revisions was not.
  #   DURABILITY WARNING — THIS RATIONALE IS COUPLED TO WHERE THE INDEX TREE LIVES, AND
  #   NOTHING TESTS THE COUPLING. Move that tree INSIDE the repo — a plausible fix for the
  #   PATH_MAX trigger on # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP, since a shorter root buys back name
  #   length — and every target becomes row 1: upstream's exemption starts applying, the
  #   size filter stops firing on its own, and `--max-target-bytes=0` becomes a no-op for
  #   the trigger it was added for. NOTHING WOULD GO RED. The flag would simply stop doing
  #   anything while this comment went on claiming it does. Any such refactor MUST
  #   RE-DERIVE the table above rather than assume it, and must not read a green suite as
  #   evidence the flag still earns its place.
  #   FALSIFIER — RUN IT, DO NOT TRUST THIS. In a scratch git repo holding one >1MB .ts,
  #   with cwd = that repo:
  #     A=(--config=.semgrep/soif-dom-sinks.yml --no-git-ignore --severity=ERROR --error)
  #     semgrep scan "${A[@]}" big.ts               # in-project  -> Targets scanned: 1
  #     semgrep scan "${A[@]}" /elsewhere/big.ts    # out-project -> Targets scanned: 0
  #   PRECONDITION, without which NEITHER row moves: the file must exceed 1 MB. Under the
  #   cap both read `Targets scanned: 1`, and a reader who tries it there sees no
  #   difference and wrongly concludes the claim is unverifiable.
  #   If `--max-target-bytes` is ever reinstated (see BL-187), the deleted `Scan skipped`
  #   excerpt becomes live again and its removal should be reconsidered — do not conclude

  # COLLAPSES the utility's exit code (BSD xargs -> 1, GNU xargs -> 123 for ANY
  # non-zero), which makes semgrep's "blocking findings" code (1) indistinguish-
  # able from a semgrep TOOL failure (>=2: bad config, registry unreachable,
  # parse error). The two must be told apart — one blocks, the other warns.
  # BL-179-STAGED-FILTER — the filter is ACMRT, and the inclusion of R and T AND the
  # exclusion of D are each load-bearing. They are not the same decision as the BL-125
  # test arm's ACMDR (~120 lines below) and must not be copied from it.
  #   THE TEST THIS FILTER MUST PASS: does the status letter denote a staged entry that
  #   HAS SCANNABLE CONTENT OF ITS OWN? A,C,M,R,T all do; D does not. Anything else and
  #   the receipt below stops meaning what it says.
  #   R (RENAME) MUST BE INCLUDED. `diff.renames` defaults to TRUE, so a commit that
  #   renames a file AND edits it in the same breath is reported as ONE status-R entry
  #   — which the old ACM filter EXCLUDED. soif_staged came back EMPTY, and since the
  #   arm below was a `-gt 0` test with NO `else`, the scanner produced NO OUTPUT AT
  #   ALL: no [OK], no [BLOCKED], and not even the loud NOTRUN every other can't-scan
  #   path routes to. A routine rename-and-edit refactor walked an innerHTML sink past
  #   the gate in total silence (BL-179, reproduced through the real emitter, the real
  #   .git/hooks/pre-commit and a real `git commit`). For an R entry `--name-only -z`
  #   emits the DESTINATION path, and `:0:<dest>` resolves to its staged blob, so the
  #   materialization loop below needs no change at all.
  #   T (TYPE CHANGE) MUST BE INCLUDED, and this one is the quieter hole because it does
  #   NOT route to the empty-staged report. Replacing a symlink with a regular file is
  #   ordinary repo hygiene; git calls it T, the old ACMR filter dropped it, and a CLEAN
  #   SIBLING in the same commit kept soif_staged non-empty — so the arm sailed past the
  #   # BL-179-EMPTY-STAGED else and printed `[OK] … ran on N staged file(s)` with N
  #   counting only the sibling while the dropped entry carried an innerHTML sink
  #   (R-WPC-1, reproduced through the real emitter and a real `git commit`: verdict
  #   COMMITTED, sink present in the committed tree). A truncated TARGET SET produces
  #   exactly the unearned receipt # BL-182-NO-UNEARNED-RECEIPT guards against, but the
  #   loop never sees the entry, so that guard cannot fire — only the filter can.
  #   T IS SAFE WHERE D IS NOT, and the difference is the whole reason both letters are
  #   spelled out here. Verified on git 2.50.1: `git cat-file -t ":0:<path>"` returns
  #   `blob` for a T entry in BOTH directions — symlink->file (index mode 100644) and
  #   file->symlink (index mode 120000) — and for gitlink->file. T therefore never
  #   manufactures a phantom unreadable entry. (A ->gitlink T would present index mode
  #   160000 and be absorbed by # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP, which is already correct. A bare
  #   permission flip is reported M, not T, and was always covered.)
  #   D (DELETION) MUST STAY EXCLUDED. The BL-125 arm includes D because it must RUN
  #   THE TESTS when a sanitizer is deleted; THIS arm must SCAN CONTENT, and a deleted
  #   path has no staged content to scan. Including it hands the loop an index entry
  #   whose `git cat-file -t ":0:<path>"` fails (verified: exit 128) — manufacturing a
  #   phantom unreadable entry, i.e. a fresh instance of the very class BL-182 retires
  #   below. Pinned in all three directions by the ACMRT->ACMT, ACMRT->ACMR and
  #   ACMRT->ACMDRT mutation cases in tests/test-bl132-sast-index-scan.sh.

    # `git add app.ts` (vuln), overwrite app.ts clean, and the COMMITTED bytes were
    # never scanned — the flaw shipped with an [OK] receipt (BL-132 repro; `git add
    # -p` / stage-then-edit share the hole). Materialize each staged blob into a
    # throwaway tree that mirrors the repo layout (same relative path + extension so
    # semgrep still picks the language, under a per-entry subdir — see the
    # BL-178-PER-INDEX-DIR note in the loop), then hand semgrep the EXPLICIT
    # materialized FILE targets (collected in soif_idx_files), never the tree dir.
    #   WHY EXPLICIT FILES, NOT THE DIRECTORY (verifier F1): pointing semgrep at a
    #   directory re-engages its built-in default .semgrepignore — staged sinks under
    #   tests/ test/ build/ dist/ vendor/ node_modules/ and *.min.js are then SILENTLY
    #   skipped and the commit lands with a false [OK] receipt. `--no-git-ignore` does
    #   NOT disable those built-in defaults. Explicit file targets bypass ignore
    #   filtering by semgrep's own documented semantics and restore the pre-BL-132
    #   contract by construction.
    #   THE RECEIPT COUNTS TARGETS, NOT STAGED ENTRIES. Since # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP
    #   the two can legitimately differ (a staged submodule gitlink has no bytes to
    #   scan), so the "[OK] … ran on N staged file(s)" line reports
    #   ${#soif_idx_files[@]} — what was ACTUALLY targeted — and zero targets routes
    #   to NOTRUN (# BL-132-EMPTY-TARGETS) rather than claiming a scan.
    # bash-3.2 and NUL-safe: soif_staged was read -z above; each path is round-tripped
    # through `git cat-file blob :0:<path>` — the STAGE-EXPLICIT form, see
    # # BL-132-STAGE0-REF in the loop; a bare `:<path>` is NOT safe for arbitrary
    # staged names. A pathname git cannot express (a NUL byte) cannot be staged, so it
    # cannot reach here.
    # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP — THE ALL-OR-NOTHING `break` IS RETIRED. Every failure
    # point in this loop used to do `soif_idx_ok=0; break`, which DISCARDED every
    # sibling already materialized and routed the WHOLE commit to NOTRUN — so a sink
    # staged in a readable sibling LANDED. That is strictly worse than scanning
    # nothing, and the mechanism produced THREE separate defects in this one loop: a
    # submodule gitlink (R-270-1), a repo-root path matching git's `:<stage>:<path>`
    # syntax (R-270-1B), and a repo-relative path too long to express under the
    # `mktemp -d` root (BL-182). Patching a fourth trigger was the wrong move; the
    # CLASS is retired instead. Each unreadable entry is recorded in soif_idx_unread
    # and the loop CONTINUES, so coverage degrades entry-by-entry instead of
    # collapsing. The honesty half is non-negotiable and lives after the loop:
    #   • any finding in what DID materialize still BLOCKS (# BL-182-PARTIAL-STILL-BLOCKS)
    #   • a CLEAN scan over a PARTIAL set is NOT a clean scan and never earns the [OK]
    #     receipt (# BL-182-NO-UNEARNED-RECEIPT)
    #   • every NOTRUN caused by an unreadable entry NAMES it (# BL-182-NAME-THE-ENTRY)

      #   THIS IS NOT A BLANKET "unreadable => skip". The skip is gated on the index

      #   object makes `cat-file -t` fail while ls-files still reports mode 100644.
      #   THE TWO OUTCOMES ARE NO LONGER THE SAME SHAPE (# BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP): a
      #   gitlink `continue`s with NO trace, because it is not content and its absence
      #   from the scan costs the operator nothing; an unreadable entry `continue`s
      #   INTO soif_idx_unread, which forfeits the [OK] receipt for the whole commit
      #   and is reported by name. Keep that distinction — collapsing them would let a
      #   real unscanned blob buy a clean-looking commit.
      #   CAUTION, and the reason # BL-132-STAGE0-REF below exists: a failing
      #   `cat-file -t` does NOT imply a missing/corrupt object. An earlier revision
      #   of this comment enumerated it as the only other cause; R-270-1B REFUTED
      #   that — it also fails for a perfectly HEALTHY blob when the reference itself
      #   is mis-parsed. Widen this skip only against a re-derived enumeration.
      # BL-132-STAGE0-REF — address the index at an EXPLICIT stage, `:0:<path>`, never
      # a bare `:<path>`. Git reads `:<0-3>:<path>` as a MERGE-STAGE reference, so for
      # a staged file whose REPO-ROOT name begins with `0:`..`3:` (e.g. `2:evil.js`)
      # the bare form parses as "stage 2 of evil.js" and FAILS on a fully readable
      # blob. That is no gitlink, so the skip above does not fire: the entry fell
      # through to the loop's then-existing `soif_idx_ok=0; break` (since retired by
      # # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP), discarding every sibling target and NOTRUNning the
      # WHOLE commit while a vulnerable sibling LANDED — a security-lane
      # regression versus main, the same "one bad entry blinds the commit" shape as the
      # gitlink bug (R-270-1B, reproduced A/B through the real emitter). THE STAGE-0
      # PREFIX IS STILL LOAD-BEARING after that retirement: without it such an entry
      # becomes an UNREADABLE entry, which forfeits the commit's [OK] receipt and
      # NOTRUNs on content that was perfectly readable all along. Boundaries,

      # binary heuristic reads only the FIRST 8000 bytes, so a UTF-16 file whose
      # first NUL sits later would be exempted as "text" and slip the classifier;
      # the NUL count below reads the whole file (one streaming `tr` per staged
      # blob, gated behind F2) and has no such window. Strictly stronger, same
      # decision tree.
      #   The classifier, exhaustive (WP0): NUL-free → passthrough (UTF-8, Latin-1,
      #   Shift-JIS and friends — semgrep handles them; "NUL-free AND valid UTF-8"
      #   is the WRONG tightening, it breaks Latin-1). NULs+BOM → the BOM is a
      #   CLAIM, matched LONGEST-FIRST (`FF FE` is a prefix of the UTF-32LE BOM),
      #   and it must AGREE with the whole-body derivation — a lying BOM otherwise
      #   transcodes to NUL-free valid-UTF-8 garbage that scans clean and mints
      #   the receipt over a live sink. NULs+no-BOM → whole-file zero-parity
      #   derivation (never a head window: a CJK comment block has no NULs in its
      #   head), stride-aware (2-byte vs 4-byte per BOM family; UTF-32 is
      #   attempted via BOM only). The rule is ALL-zeros-on-one-parity — exact,
      #   not a ratio. NULs+no-BOM+no-signal → a source extension routes LOUD
      #   (that shape is binary content in source clothing — BL-192's own
      #   `vendor.js` residue, newly CAUGHT); anything else is a real binary and
      #   passes through untouched, exactly as today. TWO named residues,
      #   deliberately NOT closed: (a) a zero-ASCII single-line UTF-16 file has
      #   no NUL at all and passes through undecoded (bounded — any newline puts
      #   a NUL in the file); the only tightening that closes it breaks Latin-1.
      #   Pinned by T-pure-cjk-residue-passthrough. (b) one code unit whose LOW
      #   byte is 0x00 — U+0100 Ā, U+3000 ideographic space, an astral char with
      #   a zero surrogate byte — puts a zero on the wrong parity and collapses
      #   the signal: the file goes LOUD named NOTRUN, every commit, until saved

      # not "safe": the sink sat on line 2. This rides its OWN continuation line, like
      # each --config above, so a mutation test can strip exactly one thing.
      #   THE FLAG IS ONLY HALF THE FIX. It retires this TRIGGER; # BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE
      #   below retires the CLASS, and the two are proved independently — with the flag
      #   stripped, the coverage guard must still refuse the receipt.
      #   THE LATENCY TRADE IS DELIBERATE, AND THE RATIONALE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED HERE WAS
      #   MEASURABLY WRONG IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (R-274Rv2-2). It said (a) "if semgrep cannot
      #   cope it exits >=2 and the arm WARNs loudly" and (b) "keep the cap and let the
      #   coverage guard turn every oversize entry into a NOTRUN is worse — all of the cost
      #   and none of the coverage." Measured on 1.157.0, both fail for the case this
      #   comment's own examples name (a generated bundle, a vendored lib):
      #     (a) semgrep does NOT exit >=2. On a dense 1,216,567-byte .ts it exits 0 and
      #         prints `✅ Scan completed successfully.` while a rule quietly times out.
      #     (b) With the cap left at its 1,000,000 default the SELECTION guard SEES the
      #         shortfall (`accepted 0 of 1`) and forfeits the receipt. With the cap
      #         disabled semgrep accepts the file, abandons the rule on its per-rule
      #         timeout, reports full selection AND full parse coverage, and — before
      #         # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE existed — the arm CERTIFIED the commit. The flag
      #         converted a guard-VISIBLE shortfall into a guard-INVISIBLE one.
      #   THE FLAG IS STILL RIGHT, for the reason the old text got right by accident: for
      #   LOW-COMPLEXITY oversize blobs it buys real coverage (verified: the >1MB
      #   comment-padded fixture is REFUSED with the flag and merely NOTRUN without it).
      #   What made it safe is not the flag, it is # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE landing beside
      #   it. Do not restate (a) or (b); they are refuted, and they are recorded here so

      #   and no longer a deferral. 30s catches the measured dense-fixture class
      #   (blocked in ~11s WALL at timeout=0) with headroom while keeping the hard
      #   ceiling: `--timeout=0` would let a catastrophic-backtracking rule hang the

      # NO PARSE/DECODE CLAUSE HERE — WITHDRAWN ON MEASUREMENT, FILED AS BL-192, AND ITS
      # ABSENCE IS LOAD-BEARING DOCUMENTATION. A `Parsed lines: ~N%` reader sat between the
      # selection parse above and the timeout detector below, and it worked on semgrep
      # 1.157.0. On >= 1.171.0 that percentage reads ~100.0% for a file semgrep never
      # decoded, so the clause grants [OK] over an unscanned sink — a guard-shaped object,
      # which is worse than no guard. Full measurement, the `--json` / `--x-ls-long`
      # dead ends, and the open design question (a decode guard must verify the decode
      # ITSELF, not read semgrep's self-report) are on # BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE above.
      #   DO NOT RE-ADD THE CLAUSE WITHOUT RE-MEASURING THE INSTRUMENT ON THE SEMGREP THE
      #   PROJECT ACTUALLY HAS — AND NOTE WHICH SEMGREP THAT IS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO.
      #   THIS HOOK runs whatever `semgrep` is on the operator's PATH and pins nothing, so
      #   "it passed on my host" is not evidence about the host that will run it. The CI
      #   SAST job is a DIFFERENT surface and — since BL-201 — floats too: every generated
      #   CI template that runs semgrep uses `image: semgrep/semgrep:latest` and logs
      #   `semgrep --version` in the job (# BL-201-FLOAT). Both surfaces therefore track
      #   current semgrep, already past the 1.171.0 blindness line of BL-192 — which is
      #   safe only because BL-198 removed every clause that reads semgrep's self-report;
      #   the job log, not a pin, answers which version scanned any given run.
      # BL-187-RULE-COVERAGE (parse) — THE THIRD FACT, AND THE ONE THE FIRST TWO
      # STRUCTURALLY CANNOT SEE. Selection is fixed before a byte is parsed; the parse
      # percentage is fixed once the AST exists. Neither is touched by what happens NEXT:
      # semgrep starts a rule against a target, hits its default 5-second per-rule timeout,
      # abandons that rule for that target, and reports a completed scan. Measured on
      # 1.157.0 through the shipped emitter (R-274Rv2-1): a dense 1,216,567-byte .ts with
      # `pane.innerHTML = userText` on line 2 gave `Scanning 1 file`, `Targets scanned: 1`,
      # `Parsed lines: ~100.0%`, rc=0 and the full [OK] receipt, while the ONE rule that
      # catches that sink was the rule that timed out.
      #   PRESENCE, NOT A NUMBER, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE AND DOCUMENTED. The two
      #   halves above compare counts and fail closed on an unreadable line. This one asks
      #   whether a warning is THERE, so its good case is absence and "fail closed on
      #   absence" would NOTRUN every commit. See the FAIL CLOSED paragraph on
      #   # BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE: this is a trigger detector, the residue is BL-187, and it
      #   must not be described as closing the class.
      #   MATCH THE ATOM, NOT THE SENTENCE — semgrep wraps the warning across two lines at
      #   ~120 columns even when stderr is a file, so `timeout error(s)` is the whole
      #   pattern. Same defensive plumbing as the other two: `|| …=0` so `set -e` cannot
      #   abort the hook, and a case-glob sanitize before the value reaches any arithmetic.
      #   A non-numeric or unreadable count sanitizes to 0, i.e. to "no timeout seen" —
      #   which is the fail-OPEN direction and is the honest consequence of a presence
      #   test, not an oversight. It is why this clause is a floor on the guarantee and not

      # content IS this very string at column 0 contributes zero (its content never
      # enters the stream), while an already-broken file's echoed continuation lines DO
      # land at column 0 and can INFLATE the count of a scan that was forfeiting anyway
      # (only the first echoed line gets a prefix). So the anchor's job is width, not
      # immunity: indented/nested occurrences never count (pinned by
      # T-stub-anchor-indent), the count stays a warning tally on clean commits, and
      # any inflation only ever forfeits harder — never grants, never blocks. The

# contract (# BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN): not-runnable => LOUD skip, never a silent

# BLOCK (the range closes at the first `}`, so the trigger is a big block,
# not a big file), and pipefail promotes rc 141 into "no match" —
# deterministically on a monorepo-sized block (measured PIPESTATUS=141 0:
# grep MATCHED and the pipeline still reported false). The detection call
# then read a real suite as absent — the test gate silently stopped running

#   is a REAL STAGED BLOB of source, and de-symlinking a file (symlink ->
#   regular file, index mode 100644) is an ordinary refactor, not an
#   exotic shape. While this read was ACMDR such a commit was invisible

#   `[OK] BL-125: no source files staged — project tests not required for
#   this commit.` over a staged source change — verbatim the failure the
#   comment above says this filter exists to stop (R-274R-2, reproduced

#   `M src/real.ts` -> REFUSED with the suite running; `T src/lib.ts` ->
#   COMMITTED, suite never ran; same staged index, `ACMDR` sees [] and
