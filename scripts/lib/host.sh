# ── Pipeline paths ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# host_pipeline_resolve [host] — the ONE place that knows where each host keeps
# its CI and release pipelines. Sets three globals:
#
#   HOST_CI_PATH          the root pipeline file the host actually executes
#   HOST_RELEASE_PATH     where the release steps live
#   HOST_RELEASE_EXECUTES how those steps reach the runner:
#                           file    — its own file, executed directly (GitHub)
#                           include — its own file, pulled in by the root
#                                     pipeline's `include:` (GitLab)
#                           import  — its own file, pulled in by the root
#                                     pipeline's `definitions.imports` plus an
#                                     `import:` reference (Bitbucket)
#
# `file` needs no wiring. `include` and `import` DO, and a release file nothing
# references never executes — which is the deepest form of this entry's defect
# and what a reader must check beyond `[ -f ]`.
#
# THE THIRD FIELD IS NOT DECORATION. Without it every caller re-derives
# "…but Bitbucket is different" locally, which is exactly the duplication that
# produced BL-229: five scripts each hardcoded `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
# so on GitLab and Bitbucket the readers either said nothing (check-phase-gate,
# a skipped block indistinguishable from a clean one) or said something false
# (validate.sh, `[FAIL] CI pipeline missing` on a healthy project).
#
# BITBUCKET DOES SUPPORT A SAME-REPO IMPORT, AND AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS
# COMMENT SAID IT DID NOT. That false premise shipped in four places and drove a
# design decision; it is corrected here rather than quietly deleted. Atlassian
# documents `definitions: imports: <name>: <path>` with a same-repo path, and
# the imported file declares `export: true`. So Bitbucket gets a separate
# release file like the other two — it simply needs two wiring points instead of
# GitLab's one (the `imports` declaration, and an `import:` reference under the
# start-condition).
#
# What is genuinely NOT available on Bitbucket is GitLab's transparent
# `include:` — the imported pipeline must be referenced by name. That is the
# real asymmetry, and it is smaller than the one previously claimed.
#
# SYNC SIBLINGS — STATED HONESTLY, because an earlier version of this comment
# claimed there were none and that was not true. This function owns
# HOST_RELEASE_PATH outright: init.sh's `case "$host"` was its only other copy
# and is now a call. HOST_CI_PATH still has live siblings that this branch does
# NOT convert — `scripts/verify-install.sh` (`_ci_dest`, and the fix_ci_pipeline
# writer), `scripts/reconfigure-project.sh`, `scripts/validate.sh`'s
# Competency-Matrix guard, `scripts/check-updates.sh` and `scripts/check-gate.sh`.
# The first enumeration here named three and its own recipe found six; the
# validate.sh one matters most, because it makes that whole check SILENTLY SKIP
# on GitLab and Bitbucket — this entry's defect class, in the file this entry
# fixes. Derive the current set rather than trusting this sentence:
#
#   grep -rn '\.gitlab-ci\|bitbucket-pipelines\|\.github/workflows' scripts/ init.sh
#
# cf. `# BL-084-TIER-KEY`, which exists because a different predicate grew
# copies. Callers ask for the RELEASE path; they do not re-derive it.

# THREE MECHANISMS HAVE FAILED HERE, EACH VERIFYING THE PREVIOUS ONE'S MISTAKE:
#   1. `awk -v` with a multi-line body — BSD awk rejects the newline, the splice
#      never ran, and the caller printed success.
#   2. `[ -f ]` on the release file — existence is not execution; an
#      unreferenced file reported as configured.
#   3. `grep -q "$rel" "$ci"` — a SUBSTRING test, satisfied by a mention in a
#      comment, and satisfied even when `sed` had inserted a SECOND `imports:`
#      key that YAML then discarded, taking the real declaration with it.
# Hence: merge into an existing block rather than emitting a rival one, and
# verify STRUCTURE — anchored keys, and the reference actually invoked.

#   1  NOT wired — a real defect
#   2  CANNOT TELL — the file's shape is beyond these greps
#
# THE THIRD STATE IS NOT PEDANTRY. This is anchored-grep matching, not a YAML
# parse, so flow style (`definitions: {imports: {...}}`) and multi-document
# files are shapes it cannot read. Answering "not wired" there would tell a
# CORRECTLY wired project that its release will never run — which is BL-229's
# own false-failure symptom, relocated. Callers must fail closed on 2 (a gate
# that cannot measure must not pass) while SAYING something different from 1.
