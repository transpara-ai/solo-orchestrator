# scripts/lib/tdd-classify.sh — BL-072 shared file-classification core.
#
# The TDD-ordering detector (Phase C1, WARN mode) must classify a set of
# changed paths into "implementation files" vs "test files" the SAME way in
# two places:
#   - the LIVE pre-commit gate    (scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh), fed by
#                                  `git diff --cached --name-only`
#   - the dogfood REPLAY tool     (tests/test-helpers/dogfood-bl072-replay.sh),
#                                  fed by `git diff-tree --no-commit-id
#                                  --name-only -r <sha>`
#
# Factoring the classifier into this one sourced library is a hard BL-072
# requirement: live and replay MUST agree byte-for-byte, otherwise the
# measured false-block rate would not describe the gate that would actually
# ship. Both callers source this file and call `_bl072_classify_paths`.
#
# IMPORTANT — the classifier is a pure function of the PATH SET only. It does
# NOT read diff content. This is deliberate: the replay's per-commit view
# (`git diff-tree`) is path-only, so a content-aware rule (e.g. a
# "pure-comment-only change" carve-out) could not be applied identically in
# both places. Pure-comment-only detection is therefore a documented C1
# limitation (see BL-072 in the backlog and the dogfood report). Because C1
# is WARN-only — the gate never blocks — over-counting comment-only commits
# is safe and simply shows up as false positives in the dogfood, which is the
# whole point of the measurement.
#
# shellcheck shell=bash
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).

#     class was repo-root markdown misclassified as impl.
#   - lockfiles / generated dependency manifests (package-lock.json, *.lock,
#     yarn.lock) are machine-generated, not authored implementation.
# Pure-DELETION exclusion is NOT here (a path alone cannot say "deleted"); it
