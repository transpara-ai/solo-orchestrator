# scripts/lib/bypass-audit.sh — BL-029 audit-log writer library.

# detector, init/reconfigure recorders) don't race on the file.

  # D3 fix (post-PR-A): create the temp file ADJACENT to the audit
  # file so the subsequent `mv` is a same-filesystem rename — atomic
  # on POSIX. With $TMPDIR mktemp (/var/folders on macOS), the audit
  # file lives on a different filesystem from /tmp/* or $HOME-based
  # project dirs, turning `mv` into copy+unlink. A SIGKILL during the
  # write window can then truncate the append-only ledger.
  #
  # Audit fix code-lib-2 (2026-06-28): two residual hardenings.
  # (a) Preserve target file permissions across the rename. mktemp
  #     defaults to 0600; if the operator chmod'd the ledger to e.g.
  #     0640 for a shared-team setup, the post-rename file would
  #     silently revert. _bypass_audit_preserve_mode tries GNU
  #     `chmod --reference`, then BSD/GNU `stat`-then-`chmod`, then
  #     a `chmod 600` fallback — keeps the operator's intent on
  #     either platform.
  # (b) Trap on EXIT/INT/TERM so a signal between mktemp and either
  #     branch doesn't leave an orphan ${file}.XXXXXX littering the
  #     governance dir.
  #
  # Verifier follow-up (2026-06-28): wrap the rename window in a
  # SUBSHELL. bash `trap` is shell-global, not function-local — the
  # prior `trap '...' EXIT INT TERM` / `trap - EXIT INT TERM` pair at
  # function scope silently destroyed any pre-existing EXIT trap the
  # caller had installed. Containing the trap in a subshell means it
  # only governs that subshell's exit; the caller's trap survives
  # untouched. tmp/rc must be captured from the subshell's exit code
  # since locals don't propagate up.
