# scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-stubs.sh — the parts of adoption that are NOT built,
# said out loud at the point in the run where they belong.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §10 — WP5 (the
# certification pass), WP5b (the test-debt ledger), WP7 (the CI carve-out, the
# provenance headers and the Adoption Record), §6.3 (per-finding secrets
# disposition, which §10 assigns to no package).
#
# WP6 IS NO LONGER IN THAT LIST, and the header is the first place that had to
# change when it landed: §7's collision archive, its MANIFEST, the disclosure
# and the recorded re-adds all ship (scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-archive.sh). What
# remains unbuilt around it is named honestly by the two stubs below — the
# adoptee's framework DOCUMENTS and the REPLACEMENT half for framework-script
# collisions — and both are attributed to nobody, because nobody owns them.
# A stub file whose own header still claims a delivered package is exactly the
# "measured and clean" misreading these stubs exist to prevent, one level up.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY STUBS EXIST AT ALL, AND WHAT MAKES ONE HONEST.
#
# A driver that quietly skipped the certification pass would produce a project
# that LOOKS certified: an `adoption` block with three empty certification
# arrays reads, to anyone who finds it later, exactly like "we measured and
# there was nothing to record". §5.1's indictment of bare grandfathering is
# that "nothing is measured; nothing is recorded; the exemption is the ABSENCE
# of a field" — an unannounced stub reproduces all three properties.
#
# So each stub below prints, at the moment the real thing would have run, what
# did not happen and which work package owns it. None of them returns a result,
# none of them writes a record, and none of them can be mistaken for a pass.
# They are load-bearing honesty, and they are the whole of WP4's answer to the
# parts of adoption it does not implement.

# WP5b — the test-debt ledger and its ratchet (§5.4) — RETIRED, NOT DELETED IN
# SPIRIT. The stub that used to live here said "existing untested files are not
# recorded, so nothing yet stops that set from growing". They are recorded now:
# scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-test-debt.sh writes .claude/test-debt.json during the
# run and adopt_test_debt_record announces what it measured. The one thing WP5b
# does NOT ship is an automatic commit-time invocation — §10 gives WP7 the
# commit-time hook — and adopt_stub_hooks below already carries that sentence,
# so a second stub here would be a duplicate notice, not an extra honesty.

# THE FRAMEWORK-SCRIPT COLLISION CLASS — a file of theirs sitting at a path a
# framework SCRIPT wants. WP6 landed the collision archive, so this notice no
# longer says "not archived": it says what is genuinely still missing, which is
# the REPLACEMENT half.
#
# WHY WP6'S ARCHIVE DOES NOT COVER THIS CLASS, stated rather than left as a
# gap. §7.1's archive-and-replace population is their AI-LAYER surfaces and
# their GIT HOOKS, and that boundary is deliberate: archiving-and-replacing an
# adoptee's `scripts/validate.sh` with the framework's would swap out a file
# their own CI may call, on day one, with no operator decision in between —
# the same class of harm §7.4 refuses for their pipelines. Which package owns
# that decision is not settled in §10, so it is named here and not assumed.
