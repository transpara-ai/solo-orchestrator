# scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-archive.sh — §7's COLLISION ARCHIVE: the inventory,
# the archive tree and its MANIFEST, the plain disclosure, the recorded re-add,
# and §7.3's archive-secrets refusal.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §7.1 (the four
# buckets, and the vocabulary is reused rather than reinvented), §7.2 (the
# layout, the MANIFEST, and the five properties inherited from
# `_upgrade_snapshot_pre_mutation` in scripts/upgrade-project.sh), §7.3
# (disclosure, re-adds, the warning, and THE NEW EXPOSURE this design creates),
# §6.2 (redaction is a PROJECTION, not a flag), §8.9 (the `adoption_event` row
# and the five surfaces a new row type touches), §12-5, §10-WP6.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE ONE SENTENCE THIS FILE EXISTS TO IMPLEMENT
#
# The operator's own configuration is copied somewhere they can get it back
# from, every copy is named out loud with a restore line, and NOTHING is
# committed until a secret scanner has looked at it.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §7.3'S EXPOSURE, IN THE PLAINEST TERMS, BECAUSE IT IS THE REASON THIS FILE IS
# WRITTEN THE WAY IT IS
#
# `.git/hooks/` is NOT tracked by git. `.claude/` IS. So copying a hook into
# the archive and staging the archive takes a file git has never seen — a file
# that may hold a token the operator put there precisely because it would never
# be committed — and COMMITS IT. Adoption would create the leak. The same is
# true of any `.claude/settings.local.json` the operator gitignored.
#
# So: the archive is written, then SCANNED, and only then staged, and an entry
# the scanner matched is never handed to `git add`. The refusal is per ENTRY,
# not per run — a secret in one hook must not cost the operator the record of
# everything else.
#
# AND WHEN NOBODY LOOKED, NOTHING IS STAGED. If gitleaks is absent or the scan
# fails, every entry is withheld. "We could not check" and "we checked and it
# is clean" are different claims and only one of them may result in a commit.
# The archive is still written to disk and still disclosed — the operator keeps
# their copy — it simply does not enter version control on an unexamined tree.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE PROJECTION (§6.2's doctrine, applied to a surface §6.2 does not mention)
#
# gitleaks emits EIGHTEEN fields per finding and `--redact` covers exactly two
# of them, `Secret` and `Match`. It does NOT touch `Message` — the full commit
# message — which WP2 demonstrated carries a planted key straight through a
# "redacted" report. Nothing here passes the tool's report through: the one
# read of it NAMES the three fields it wants and can express no other. A field
# gitleaks adds in a future release is dropped because it was never named.
#
# THE ARCHIVE SCAN IS A `gitleaks dir` OVER THE ARCHIVE DIRECTORY ALONE, and
# that has a second, deliberate property: the adoptee's own `.gitleaks.toml`
# lives at their project root, not inside the archive, so a REPO-LOCAL config
# that allowlists `AKIA[A-Z2-7]{16}` cannot suppress this scan. A clean bill of
# health issued under rules written by the thing being audited is a different
# claim, and this is the one place the framework refuses to accept it.
#
# THAT ARGUMENT COVERS THE FILE AND NOT THE ENVIRONMENT, and saying so is the
# difference between a property and a slogan: `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` and
# `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` outrank the scanned path entirely and are inherited
# from whatever launched the driver. They are unset inside the scan subshell
# for exactly that reason — see the scrub in `adopt_archive_scan`.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# M2/M3: this file is MODULE code. It sources nothing itself — the driver
# sources its libs in order — and it uses `bypass_audit_append` from
# scripts/lib/bypass-audit.sh, which scripts/adopt-project.sh declares in its
# M2 header. No core file names this file; that is M3 and the boundary lint
# proves it.
#
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no `${var,,}`, no `((x++))`.

# ── The archive-and-replace population (§7.1's first row), spelled ONCE ─────
#
# Their AI-layer surfaces — Claude settings, skills, MCP connections — and
# their git hooks. NOT their pipelines (§7.4's carve-out: audited, never
# touched) and NOT their project files (§7.5: keep theirs).
#
# `.git/hooks/*.sample` IS EXCLUDED, and the exclusion is not cosmetic: git
# ships thirteen of them in every repository, none is ever active, and
# archiving them would bury the two or three hooks the operator actually wrote
# in a list nobody reads. The disclosure's value is that a person can read it.

# ── The hook description (§7.2), and why it is a CLOSED vocabulary ──────────
#
# §7.2 requires a what-it-did description for every archived git hook and calls
# it explicitly ADVISORY. §7.3 names the hazard in the same breath: a
# hand-rolled hook can contain a token. So the description is ASSEMBLED FROM A
# FIXED LIST — the generator emits names it recognises and nothing else. A hook
# line reading `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA…` contributes exactly nothing,
# because no allowlisted token matches it.
#
# This is the same shape as the §6.2 field allowlist and the same shape as
# Scout's own hook vocabulary, and it is DUPLICATED here rather than sourced:
# Scout is a separate severable module under M1/M3, and reaching into
# scripts/lib/scout/ from here would fuse two modules that are meant to be
# liftable independently. §3.3 calls this reuse-by-extraction — copy the
# PREDICATE, not the DEPENDENCY — and this is exactly that case.

# adopt_archive_hook_description FILE — a one-sentence advisory summary.
#
# Shallow and static by design: it reads word-shaped tokens, keeps the ones on
# the list, and says "and other commands" when it dropped something. It never
# quotes a byte of the file, so it cannot leak one.
#
# THE LOOKUP IS A `case`, NOT A PIPE INTO `grep -q`, AND THAT IS A CORRECTNESS
# FIX RATHER THAN A TIDY-UP. The driver runs under `set -o pipefail`. The
# obvious spelling —
#
#     printf '%s\n' "$(_adopt_archive_hook_vocabulary)" | grep -qx -- "$tok"
#
# — makes `grep -q` exit the moment it matches, which closes the pipe under
# `printf` and kills it with SIGPIPE (141). Under `pipefail` the PIPELINE's
# status is that 141, so a SUCCESSFUL match reports failure and the token is
# discarded as unrecognised. Whether printf has finished writing before grep
# leaves is a RACE, so the same hook described the same file three different
# ways across three runs of the same suite — and the two words nearest the top
# of the vocabulary lost most often, because grep reaches them soonest. A6's
# positive control caught it only because it looks for a specific tool name; a
# "the description is non-empty" assertion would have passed every time.
#
# THE EXACT BOUNDARY, MEASURED, BECAUSE IT DECIDES WHAT A FUTURE EDITOR MAY DO.
# The race needs a producer that writes MORE THAN ONCE. With a SINGLE `write(2)`
# — one `printf` of a whole table — it is impossible rather than merely
# unlikely: grep cannot match, and therefore cannot exit, before the producer's
# only write has completed, and after it there is nothing left to SIGPIPE.
# 3000 iterations of the single-write form: zero failures. A per-LINE writer
# under the identical pipeline: 300 failures in 300. So the hazard is not the
# `| grep -q` idiom by itself — it is the idiom plus a multi-write producer,
# which a table grown past the single-write chunk (~4KiB stdio worst case) also
# becomes. **The guard this note exists for: do not "tidy" a producer here into
# per-line emission, and do not let the vocabulary grow past a single write
# while a pipeline consumes it.** The `case` form below has neither exposure,
# which is why it is the form that ships.

# ⚠ THE `.git/` EXEMPTION, AND THE CLAIM IT REPLACES (R-WP6-10). An earlier cut
# of this file asserted, and `docs/adoption.md` repeated, that "`.git/hooks/*`
# is NOT reported as ignored because git excludes `.git/` by construction".
# THAT IS FALSE, and it was verified false by measurement:
#
#     .gitignore = '*'        -> check-ignore .git/hooks/pre-commit  rc 0
#     .gitignore = 'hooks/'   -> rc 0   (.gitignore:1:hooks/)
#     .gitignore = '.git/'    -> rc 0   (.gitignore:1:.git/)
#     .gitignore = '.claude/settings.local.json' -> rc 1
#
# `git check-ignore` applies patterns to ANY pathname it is handed, `.git/`
# paths included; there is no check-ignore exemption for them, only a
# tracked-file one. The rc 1 originally observed was a property of the ANCHORED
# PATTERN in the fixture, not of git — and the test that "pinned the bound"
# used only that pattern, so it could not have seen the difference. A bound
# claim, a comment and a manual page were all wrong together.
#
# WHY THE EXEMPTION IS STILL RIGHT, on the corrected reasoning: the arm above
# exists to honour an operator INSTRUCTION about content. A gitignore statement
# about a `.git/` path is not an instruction git can honour — git never tracks
# `.git/`, so the rule changes nothing about git's own behaviour and expresses
# no decision about whether that content may be preserved. The "content, not
# path" doctrine has nothing to anchor to there. Without this guard a single
# cargo-cult `.git/` line — inert against every framework-written path, and
# common in real repositories — silently withholds the hooks, which are §7.3's
# carrier and the archive's entire purpose, while adoption reports success and
# the disclosure attributes to the operator an instruction git would never act
# on. Measured end to end before the fix: rc 0, hooks `original-gitignored`,
# zero hook copies in HEAD, every suite row green.
#
# G1b pins it against a rule that genuinely reaches (asserting the probe reaches
# first, so the case cannot silently revert to testing the anchored rule), and
# G1c mutates the guard away and watches the hooks disappear.

    # measurement: `jq FILTER file` over a ZERO-BYTE file runs across zero
    # documents, emits nothing and EXITS 0 — the append succeeded, read no
    # document, and wrote no row. Measured end to end at that commit: adopt
    # rc 0, zero "could not be recorded" in the transcript, the row lost, and
    # the zero-byte ledger COMMITTED into HEAD. Same hole via `[]\n[]`, which
    # exits 0 and duplicates the row into each document.

    # An exit code is not a receipt. "jq exited 0" and "jq read a document" are

    # `bypass_audit_append` — `jq -es 'length == 1 and (.[0] | type ==
    # "array")'` — which rejects empty, null, multi-document and non-array
    # ledgers before the append and routes them all into the failure arm below.

  # it, and asks only that the override be legible to whoever reads the ledger
  # next. Suppress the marked line and the re-add still happens — silently.
  #
  # THE RECORD IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE RESTORE, AND THAT ORDER IS THE FIX
  # (R-WP6-4). Recording afterwards made "recorded" unenforceable: on a corrupt
  # ledger or a lock timeout `bypass_audit_append` returns 1, the file had
  # already been restored, and the driver went on to print "The choice is
  # recorded in .claude/bypass-audit.json" — a false claim about the only
  # artifact the re-add's legitimacy rests on. That is the R2 mutation's
  # failure mode reachable at RUNTIME rather than by sed. Recording first makes
  # the row a PRECONDITION: no row, no re-add.
  #
  # The residual is stated rather than hidden: if the `cp` below fails, a row
  # exists for a re-add that did not happen. Over-recording is the safe
  # direction — an operator investigating a row that describes nothing loses an
  # afternoon; an override with no row is the thing §7.3 forbids — and the
  # refusal that follows a failed `cp` is loud.
  #
  # AND THE WINDOW IS EXACTLY ONE STATEMENT WIDE, WHICH IT WAS NOT (R-WP6-12).
  # The `mkdir -p` used to sit inside it too, undisclosed, so a re-add that
  # could not even create its parent directory still wrote a row claiming it
  # happened. The mkdir mutates nothing the archive governs, so it belongs
  # ABOVE the record and now runs there — which makes the residual documented
  # above the WHOLE residual rather than most of it. R5 forces that failure
  # with a regular file where a directory has to go and asserts zero rows.
