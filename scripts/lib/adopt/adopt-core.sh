# how it asks, how it refuses, and how it remembers what it wrote.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §8.3 (the three
# section classes and what "no default, no skip" has to mean in code), §8.5
# (explicit staging — which is why every write is RECORDED here), §5.5 (a run
# that does not complete must leave a SAFE state), §4.1 (the operator-facing
# register: this is written for a non-developer).
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT USE prompt_input / prompt_yes_no FROM helpers-core.sh
#
# Measured, not assumed: both of those return a DEFAULT (and prompt_yes_no a
# hard "N") the moment stdin is not a terminal, printing a [WARN] and NOT
# blocking. That behaviour is right for the greenfield installer, where an
# unattended run should proceed with sane defaults. It is exactly wrong here:
# §8.3's judgment sections are "human-mandatory, no prefill, no default, no
# skip", and data classification is "non-skippable in BOTH scenarios". A
# primitive whose unattended answer is a default cannot express either rule.
#
# So the driver reads answers itself, line by line, from stdin — which works
# identically for a person at a terminal and for a scripted run — and an
# UNANSWERED mandatory question STOPS THE ADOPTION. Stopping is safe (§5.5);
# answering on the operator's behalf is not.
#
# prompt_choice IS usable (it reads stdin unconditionally) but it loops up to
# 100 times on invalid input and returns the option TEXT on stdout mixed with
# prompts on stderr. The driver wants a single refusal on a bad answer and one
# transcript on stdout that a test can pin verbatim, so it has its own.
#
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no `((x++))`.

# adopt_module_version — the driver's own version marker. A literal, for the
# same reason Scout's is: at adoption time there may be no framework state to
# read a version out of. The suffix is information, not decoration — this build
# carries the skeleton, the chooser, placement, reverse intake AND WP6's
# collision archive, disclosure, recorded re-adds and archive-secrets refusal,
# with HONEST STUBS where WP5/WP5b/WP7 will land.
adopt_module_version() {
  printf '%s\n' "0.2.0-wp6"
}

# ── Refusal ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE ONLY WAY THIS DRIVER DECLINES TO CONTINUE. It prints WHY on stderr and
# returns 1; every caller propagates. §5.5: "adoption does not complete" is a
# real state and it must be a safe one — refusing before or between writes
# leaves the project in the §8.4 safe row, never the unsafe one.
#
# The reason is PRINTED and not also stashed in a global. An earlier cut kept
# an ADOPT_REFUSED_REASON that nothing ever read (R-WP4-4): a variable nothing
# reads is a claim nothing keeps, and it would have been read as a resume seam
# that does not exist.

# The mandatory-question refusal, spelled ONCE so the transcript is consistent.
#
# IT IS A PREFIX AND THE LABEL AFTER IT IS THE DISCRIMINATOR. Every mandatory
# question in the driver prints this same sentence, so a test that greps only
# this cannot tell WHICH question stopped the run — and one that cannot tell is
# blind to a default-on-empty in the shared reader below, which is exactly the
# hole R-WP4-1 found. Callers pass a label; tests match
# "no answer was given: <label>".

# ── Reading one answer ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ADOPT_ANSWER is the single out-parameter. bash 3.2 has no namerefs and the
# alternative — echoing the answer and capturing it in $(...) — would put the
# QUESTION inside the capture too, or force every prompt onto stderr where the
# verbatim-wording pin could not see it as one transcript.
ADOPT_ANSWER=""

# THE OPERATOR'S STDIN IS PINNED TO FD 3, AND IT HAS TO BE.
#
# The reverse-intake runner walks Scout's rows with `while read … done <<ROWS`,
# which redirects the WHOLE LOOP BODY's stdin to the row list. A question asked
# inside that body and reading plain stdin therefore eats the NEXT TABLE ROW as
# if the operator had typed it — measured, not hypothetical: the first run of
# this driver answered "Keep 'acme-api'?" with a tab-separated prefill row and
# refused. Duplicating the real stdin to fd 3 once, at the top of the run, and
# reading every answer from there makes the questions independent of whatever
# redirection the surrounding loop needs.
#
# AND THE REDIRECTION MUST NOT CARRY A `2>/dev/null`. `exec` with no command
# applies its redirections to the SHELL ITSELF and keeps them: the first cut
# read `exec 3<&0 2>/dev/null`, which duplicated stdin correctly and then sent
# every subsequent byte of stderr to /dev/null for the rest of the run. Three
# refusal cases went silent — the driver still exited non-zero, so it "worked",
# and only a `bash -x` trace that stopped mid-function showed why. A failing
# `exec` here is loud on purpose; there is nothing to suppress.
