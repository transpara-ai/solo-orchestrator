# state-creation order (§8.4), the adoption stamp's ONE call site (§8.5),
# explicit staging, and the run itself.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §8.4, §8.5, §5.5,
# §8.1, §4.3/§4.4.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §8.4 — WHY phase-state FIRST, AND WHY THE ORDER IS DATA
#
# The two failure directions are not symmetric, and that asymmetry is the whole
# reason there is an order at all. Verified by execution, per surface:
#
#   phase-state present, manifest absent
#     check-phase-gate.sh runs and exits 1; read_enforcement_level returns
#     `strict` (missing file => strict). Gates live at the strictest tier —
#     BLOCKED, which is the SAFE direction.
#
#   manifest present, phase-state absent
#     check-phase-gate.sh prints "No .claude/phase-state.json found — skipping
#     phase gate check." and exits 0. An adopted-LOOKING project with NO gate
#     enforcement at all. That row must never be reachable.
#
# Writing phase-state FIRST means every interruption lands in the top row. §5.5
# names the state this protects: "adoption does not complete" is a real state
# and it must be a SAFE one — an operator who abandons an adoption mid-way ends
# up with a blocked repository, not a silently degraded one.
#
# The honest qualification (§8.4's C4 correction, not restated as a flat
# claim): "missing manifest fails strict" is true of scripts/lib/enforcement-level.sh
# and FALSE inside check-phase-gate.sh, where the missing-manifest arm of the
# Phase 1->2 protection backstop is a `[WARN]` with NO `issues` increment. The
# ordering decision is unaffected — the tier ladder governs the commit-time
# gates and it fails closed — but the flat claim would be wrong.
#
# init.sh's create_project() uses the OPPOSITE order (manifest, intake,
# phase-state). That is not a counter-example: creation is one uninterrupted
# run ending in a commit, so no partial state is ever left behind. Adoption can
# legitimately halt at a blocker.

# _adopt_state_order — §8.4's order, spelled ONCE, as data, so that reversing
# it is a ONE-LINE edit and a mutation proof has a single site to hit.

# THE HALT HOOK IS A FAULT INJECTOR AND IT IS DELIBERATE.
#
# SOIF_ADOPT_HALT_AFTER=<stage> stops the run immediately after the named
# stage. It exists so the §8.4 table can be asserted at every interruption
# point by EXECUTION rather than by reasoning about one — the same kind of
# affordance as the bare `:` above the prefill read: not dead code, but the
# thing that makes the proof possible.
#
# It cannot weaken enforcement. Every value it accepts makes the run stop
# EARLIER, and stopping earlier is by construction the safe direction (§5.5) —
# there is no ordering of the stages under which halting produces the unsafe
# row unless the ORDER ITSELF is wrong, which is exactly what it is here to

# ── The framework install ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# adopt_install_framework ROOT — put the framework's own scripts into the
# adoptee.
#
# The set is DERIVED from init.sh's `cp` lines through the shared parser
# (soif_parse_shipped_scripts), never duplicated here: a hand-kept second copy
# of that list is precisely the drift BL-088's source-closure check exists to
# catch, and a duplicate would drift the moment either list changed. It is also
# how scripts/lib/adoption-stamp.sh reaches the adoptee — WP3's own header
# warns that without it every enabling arm silently no-ops on exactly the
# projects they were built for.
#
# NON-DESTRUCTIVE, ALWAYS. An existing file at a framework path is a COLLISION
# and collisions belong to §7/WP6; this driver records them and refuses to
# overwrite. §1.2's measured problem with init.sh is unguarded overwrites, and
# a driver that reproduced them would have earned nothing by being separate.
#
# The collision LIST is kept in memory and PRINTED by the stub, not staged into
# the run's temp directory. An earlier cut wrote it to a file under $ADOPT_WORK,
# which the EXIT trap deletes — so the list evaporated unread and only the count
# was ever used (R-WP4-4). A seam that disappears before anything can consume it
# is not a seam; WP6 owns the durable archive and its MANIFEST, and until then
# the operator gets the paths on screen.

#
# WHY AFTER THE ADOPTION COMMIT, AND NOT BEFORE. The adoption commit belongs to
# the adoptee's world: whatever hooks THEY already had should judge it, and the
# framework's should not. Everything AFTER it belongs to the framework's world,
# which is exactly §4.5's rule that no arm anywhere exempts a commit written
# after adoption day. Installing here draws that line at the commit itself, and
# it removes any temptation to reach for `--no-verify` to get past a gate the
# driver had just installed on itself.
#
# Nothing here is staged, and nothing needs to be: `.git/hooks/` is not tracked.
#
# ONLY THE COMMIT-MSG HOOK IS INSTALLED, AND THE OMISSION IS MEASURED.
#
# The commit-msg hook carries the two MESSAGE-SCOPED gates — the BL-072
# TDD-ordering gate, whose pre-adoption exemption this WP's stamp bounds, and
# the BL-006 Build-Loop check. It COMPOSES: the shared emitter appends a MARKED
# block, so an adoptee's existing commit-msg hook keeps working and gains the
# framework's gates, and a second run finds the marker and stops.
#
# The FALLBACK PRE-COMMIT HOOK IS NOT INSTALLED, and this is a measurement
# rather than a preference. Installed on an adoptee at this point in the build
# it BRICKS the repository: with it in place a fixture here could not land an
# ordinary `docs:` commit (rc 1) because the hook expects framework artifacts
# — the Adoption Record among them — that WP7 has not landed yet. Shipping a
# gate that refuses every commit is not enforcement, it is a broken project,
# and the operator's only way out would be the `--no-verify` this framework
# forbids. §10 names no owner for that hook on the adoption path, so it is
# recorded as an open decision rather than quietly assumed; adopt_stub_hooks
# says which checks are consequently NOT running.
#
# The shared writer also writes the WHOLE pre-commit file, so an adoptee's own
# pre-commit hook is §7's own archive-and-replace example, belongs to WP6, and
