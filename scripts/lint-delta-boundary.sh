# scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh — the dependency-direction boundary lint for
# the post-MVP delta track.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §3.3 (normative), with the
# module inventory at §3.1 and the build-plan row at §11-WP1. Settled decision
# D1 requires this lint FROM THE FIRST COMMIT, which is why it lands alongside
# the first module file rather than at the end of the track.
#
# (Deliberately NO `# BL-NNN-…` marker: no backlog entry exists for the delta
# build, and CLAUDE.md's citation rule is satisfied by the design-doc path
# above plus the grep-able `DELTA-BOUNDARY-*` fences below. Do not mint a BL
# marker here — scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh would red on an id nobody filed.)
#
# THE DEFECT CLASS
#   A severable module stops being severable one convenience call at a time.
#   Nobody decides to fuse the delta module into the framework; someone adds
#   `source scripts/lib/delta-state.sh` to check-phase-gate.sh on a Tuesday
#   because it was easier, and the severability property is gone with no test
#   failing. This lint makes that fusion a red check.
#
# THE PREDICATE — two directions plus two guards (§3.3)
#   1. DELTA -> CORE: allowed, and deliberately UNASSERTED. The module may
#      source helpers-core.sh, call guard_not_in_framework, read
#      phase-state.json. Asserting it would be busywork.
#   2. CORE -> DELTA: forbidden. For every file in the CORE set, no EXECUTED
#      line may name any delta-module path.
#   3. SEAM ALLOWLIST, CARDINALITY EXACTLY ONE. scripts/process-checklist.sh is
#      the sole allowlisted core file. This script asserts the array length is
#      1 and fails if it grows. A second seam is a design change and must be
#      argued, not merged.
#   4. VACUITY FLOOR. Exit 2 unless at least one delta-module file AND at least
#      one core file were found. A boundary lint that scans nothing passes
#      trivially, and a passing lint that proves nothing is worse than no lint
#      — this repo has the scar (see the BL-104 scoring inversions in
#      CLAUDE.md, where an empty manifest scored better than no manifest).
#
# THE SETS — one manifest, so they can never disagree
#   DELTA = the §3.1 inventory, spelled once in the DELTA-BOUNDARY-MANIFEST
#           fence below. Adding a module file is a one-line edit there.
#   CORE  = init.sh + scripts/*.sh + scripts/lib/*.sh + scripts/hooks/*.sh,
#           MINUS the delta inventory and MINUS this script (which names every
#           delta path by construction). The self-exclusion is by BOTH manifest
#           membership and the explicit SELF_REL path, per §3.3.
#           scripts/host-drivers/*.sh is NOT in the CORE set: §3.3 names four
#           globs and this is the fourth-glob-faithful reading. Widen it only
#           by amending the design.
#
#   A RENAMED COPY of this script inside scripts/ is NOT self-excluded, and
#   that is deliberate. Unlike scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh — where a copy could
#   silently satisfy the lint's own resolution check — a copy here is a core
#   file that names every delta path, so it reds. Fail-closed is the right
#   direction for a boundary lint.
#
# TWO MATCH TIERS, because literal paths are evadable (R-DT-6)
#   T1  LITERAL PATH. Any manifest-derived token (basename for file entries,
#       the whole prefix for directory entries) on an executed line of a CORE
#       file. Verdict: FAIL. Unambiguous — a core file names a module file.
#       T1 is NOT inline-allowlistable. The single sanctioned escape for a
#       T1-class reference is the file-level seam, whose cardinality is one.
#   T2  BARE `delta-` TOKEN on an executed line that T1 did not already catch.
#       Verdict: FAIL, with an inline allowlist that REQUIRES a reason. This is
#       what catches the variable-composition family — `"$LIB/delta-${kind}.sh"`
#       carries no literal path but still carries the prefix.
#       T2 is deliberately coarse and will occasionally fire on prose in a
#       string (an error message that says "delta-state"). That is the right
#       trade: a false positive costs one allowlist row with a reason; a false
#       negative costs the severability property silently.
#
#   NAMED RESIDUAL (§13-R15, restated so nobody reads this lint as complete):
#   a reference composed BELOW the prefix boundary — `"$LIB/del""ta-state.sh"`,
#   or a path assembled from a variable holding `delta` — evades both tiers,
#   and no grep-based lint can catch it. The backstop is behavioural, not
#   lexical: WP7's severability test (delete the module, revert the seam, the
#   full suite must pass) fails on a fused module however the fusion is spelled.
#   Second residual: matching is CASE-SENSITIVE, because every path in the
#   inventory is lower-case and a case-insensitive T2 would fire on ordinary
#   prose like "DELTA-001".
#
# EXECUTED LINES ONLY — and why the exact spelling is load-bearing
#   Both tiers match against a STRIPPED copy of each file: whole-line comments
#   blanked, trailing comments truncated, at any indent and any whitespace
#   width, with and without a space after `#`. The stripper is the
#   DELTA-BOUNDARY-STRIP expression below and it is two sed expressions, in
#   this order:
#     E1  s/^[[:space:]]*#.*$//                        whole-line comments
#     E2  s/\([^[:space:]]\)[[:space:]][[:space:]]*#.*$/\1/   trailing comments
#   E1 BLANKS rather than DELETES, so the stripped file has the same number of
#   lines as the original and `grep -n` on it yields true source line numbers.
#   That is the whole reason for the blank-not-delete choice; do not "simplify"
#   it to `grep -v`. (Note what "blanks" does and does NOT mean: `s///` replaces
#   only the MATCHED REGION. On a whole-line comment the match spans the line so
#   the result is empty; on any other line it removes only what it matched. A
#   mutation to this expression therefore truncates lines, it does not erase
#   them — an earlier version of this header claimed otherwise and an
#   adversarial review refuted it.)
#
#   This predicate has repo scar tissue. scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh
#   carries the sibling version (`# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE`) and CLAUDE.md
#   records that a ONE-CHARACTER narrowing of it — a quantifier, a character
#   class, or `#` -> `#[[:space:]]` — re-opened the same hole THREE times while
#   passing both PR-blocking checks every time.
#
#   BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE HAZARDS, AND THEY ARE NOT SYMMETRIC IN COST TO DETECT:
#     • NARROWING (strips too little) -> false POSITIVES -> any clean fixture
#       reds. Cheap to catch; cases X2/X3/X4/X5 do it.
#     • WIDENING (strips too much) -> false NEGATIVES -> the tree goes QUIETER,
#       and no clean fixture can ever notice. Caught only by a VIOLATION fixture
#       positioned where the widened match would reach: case X8. Three separate
#       one-character-class widenings (drop E1's `^`; E1 -> `s/#.*$//`; E2's
#       `[[:space:]][[:space:]]*` -> `[[:space:]]*`) each survived the other 27
#       cases and every PR-blocking check until X8 existed.
#   Each atom is pinned for WIDTH and SPELLING (not merely presence) by
#   tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh cases X1-X8; that file's header maps
#   atom -> case, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, and records which mutant each row kills.
#   Before changing one character here, read it — and if you add a stripper
#   atom, add its widening pin too, not just its narrowing pin.
#
#   Both stages require the `#` to sit at line start or after whitespace, which
#   is bash's own rule: `echo "ref=x#delta-state.sh"` is one WORD, not a
#   comment, so the path is genuinely referenced (cases X7 and X8 — X7 guards
#   the line from being deleted wholesale, X8 guards the token after the `#`
#   from being truncated away).
#   Known limit, inherited from the sibling predicate: a `#` inside a quoted
#   string that follows whitespace (`sed 's/ #.*//'`) truncates the line early,
#   so a delta token AFTER such a `#` is missed. Quote-awareness costs a
#   char-by-char scan; the trade is the same one lint-tests-registered.sh made.
#
# ALLOWLIST — inline, reason REQUIRED, marker matched as an EXACT TOKEN
#   Append `# lint-delta-boundary: allow <reason>` to a T2-flagged line. The
#   marker must be followed by whitespace or end-of-line: `allowed because …`
#   and `allowlist …` are NOT the marker and do not waive anything (case L7).
#   Prefix matching would have parsed `allowed because x` as the marker with
#   reason "ed because x", so a typo could silently waive a real violation. An
#   empty reason FAILS, matching the allowlist semantics of
#   lint-fix-functions-stderr.sh and lint-bl-markers.sh. The marker lives in a
#   comment, so it is read off the RAW line after the tiers have matched
#   against the STRIPPED one.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 — no core -> delta edge.
#   1 — one or more violations, OR the seam allowlist failed its integrity
#       check (cardinality != 1, or a row with no reason). Both are "a human
#       must argue this", which is the exit-1 class; a malformed allowlist is
#       not an invocation error.
#   2 — invocation / I/O error, OR the vacuity floor tripped.
#   Order of checks: seam integrity (a property of this script, checkable
#   without the tree) -> vacuity floor (a property of the tree) -> the scan.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh              # quiet pass/fail
#   bash scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh --list       # PASS/FAIL table
#   bash scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh --root DIR   # scan an alternate tree
#       (hermetic fixtures; used by tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh).
#       The vacuity floor is NOT relaxed under --root — the floor is one of
#       the things the fixtures exist to prove.
#
# BASH 3.2 COMPATIBILITY
#   macOS ships bash 3.2.57 as /bin/bash. No associative arrays, no ${var,,},
#   no `((x++))`, no nullglob (unmatched globs survive literally and are
#   filtered with `[ -f ]`). Every array expansion is length-guarded because
#   `"${arr[@]}"` on an EMPTY array is an unbound-variable error under `set -u`
#   in 3.2 — and the empty-manifest mutation (V3) walks straight into it.
