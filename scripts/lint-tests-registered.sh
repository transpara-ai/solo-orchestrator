#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh — fail CI if any tests/test-*.sh
# (or tests/edge-cases-*.sh) file is not invoked by at least one
# top-level test aggregator. Structural backstop for the BL-034 /
# BL-038 orphan-test defect class (closes BL-038).
#
# THE DEFECT CLASS
#   Wave 1-4 (PR #103 audit) found 16 of 17 newly-added test files
#   landed without ever being wired into an aggregator. The tests
#   passed locally during PR review, then ran ZERO times after merge
#   — every subsequent regression they would have caught flew silent.
#   BL-034 retroactively registered the Wave 1-4 cohort; BL-035 will
#   disposition the pre-existing orphan backlog. BL-038 is the
#   structural prevention: this lint refuses to merge a new
#   `tests/test-*.sh` file unless an aggregator invokes it (or the
#   file carries an explicit EXEMPT marker with a non-empty reason).
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS AN AGGREGATOR
#   Five aggregators are recognised by default; pass --aggregators to
#   override the list (used by tests/test-lint-tests-registered.sh).
#     • tests/full-project-test-suite.sh
#     • tests/edge-case-test-suite.sh
#     • tests/known-bugs-test-suite.sh
#     • tests/upgrade-path-tests.sh
#     • tests/host-drivers/run-all.sh
#   The host-drivers/run-all.sh entry uses a glob over
#   `*.test.sh` and `*.selftest.sh`, so any file matching those
#   patterns under tests/host-drivers/ is implicitly registered.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A TEST FILE
#   The walker enumerates:
#     • tests/test-*.sh
#     • tests/edge-cases-*.sh
#     • tests/host-drivers/*.test.sh
#     • tests/host-drivers/*.selftest.sh
#   The aggregator files themselves are skipped (they're delegators,
#   not tests). Files under tests/test-helpers/ (if/when that dir
#   exists) are skipped as helpers. The lint script itself is skipped.
#
# OVERRIDE MECHANISM (per-file EXEMPT marker)
#   A test file can opt out by placing one of:
#     # LINT_TEST_REGISTRATION_EXEMPT: <non-empty reason>
#   …inside the first 40 lines (header). The reason is REQUIRED —
#   an empty reason fails the lint, matching the allowlist semantics
#   of scripts/lint-counter-antipattern.sh and siblings. Use this for
#   genuine manual / network-dependent / slow tests that intentionally
#   stay out of the aggregator-driven suite.
#
# BRIDGE: KNOWN_ORPHANS_PENDING_BL035
#   ~48 pre-existing test files were already orphaned when BL-038
#   landed. Editing every one to add an EXEMPT marker would be 48
#   scattered diffs that have to be unwound when BL-035 dispositions
#   them. Instead they are listed in KNOWN_ORPHANS_PENDING_BL035
#   below — a single centralised bridge. The contract is:
#     • Adding to the list requires a paired BL-035 backlog update.
#     • Removing from the list requires the test be registered in an
#       aggregator (or replaced with a real EXEMPT marker if it is
#       a manual/network-only test).
#     • When BL-035 closes, this list must be empty.
#   BL-035/BL-052 CLOSED (2026-07-06): the bridge is drained AND SEALED.
#   The array is now permanently empty and an invariant guard hard-FAILs
#   the lint (exit 1) if any entry ever reappears — the escape hatch
#   cannot be reopened. This is the durable closure of the BL-035/BL-038
#   orphan-test defect class.
#   Test fixtures (tests-dir override) skip the bridge — only the
#   canonical repo tests dir consults it.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 — every test file is registered, EXEMPT, or on the bridge list.
#   1 — one or more violations found.
#   2 — invocation / I/O error.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh           # quiet pass/fail
#   bash scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh --list    # PASS/FAIL table
#   bash scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh \
#       --tests-dir   /tmp/fixture/tests \
#       --aggregators /tmp/fixture/tests/myagg.sh
#       # test-mode: scan an alternate dir + alternate aggregator set
#
# PERFORMANCE (BL-067)
#   The original scan_file() looped over every aggregator and grepped
#   for each test's basename — O(n_tests × m_aggregators) subprocesses.
#   On the current repo shape (~100 tests × 5 aggregators × 2 greps
#   per aggregator + head/cut per file) that's ~1500+ subprocesses per
#   run; on a heavily loaded workstation this can wall-clock beyond
#   2 minutes and trip the pre-commit gate's timeout (BL-067 report).
#
#   This implementation collapses the work to O(n + m):
#     Pass 1: build a hash-set of every .sh basename referenced on a
#             non-comment line of every aggregator (one grep per
#             aggregator, then a pure-bash extraction loop).
#     Pass 2: enumerate test files under tests/ and check membership
#             in the hash-set in O(1). All per-file work (basename,
#             EXEMPT marker parsing) uses bash builtins — zero
#             subprocess spawn per file.
#   Output format, exit codes, diagnostics, and every branch of the
#   original decision tree (aggregator skip, host-drivers helper skip,
#   EXEMPT marker, bridge list, --list mode, --tests-dir override,
#   test-mode fixture semantics) are preserved byte-for-byte.

# BL-067 PASS 1: build REGISTERED_STR — a pipe-delimited string that
# encodes every .sh basename referenced on a non-comment line across
# ALL aggregators. Membership is `case "$REGISTERED_STR" in *"|$b|"*)`.
#
# Why a delimited string and not `declare -A`?
#   macOS ships bash 3.2 as /bin/bash, and the test suite (plus every
#   caller in scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh) invokes the linter through
#   /usr/bin/env bash which resolves to /bin/bash on default Macs.
#   Associative arrays are a bash 4.0+ feature — using them would
#   crash the lint on the exact platform the pre-commit gate runs on.
#   A pipe-delimited-string lookup is O(len(string)) per query, but
#   len(string) ≤ ~4KB for the whole repo — comfortably below the
#   O(n × m × grep-per-agg) subprocess cost that BL-067 is retiring.
#
# Contract semantics preserved from the original implementation:
#   • A "reference" is any occurrence of a token matching *.sh in
#     any file path (with or without leading directory components)
#     on a non-comment line of an aggregator.
#   • A line is a "comment line" iff its first non-whitespace char is
#     `#`. Inline trailing comments (e.g.
#     `bash test-foo.sh # note`) still count as references because
#     the leading token isn't `#`.
#   • Basename is derived via ${path##*/}, matching the original
#     $(basename "$file") semantics.

#
# BL-181 — THE EXEMPTION PREDICATE IS ABOUT INVOCATION, NOT MENTION.
#   The original predicate was a whole-file `grep -q 'init\.sh' "$file"`, i.e.
#   the `grep -L 'init\.sh'` generator convention the tests.yml comment
#   documents. That convention is a human-eyeball heuristic; as an ENFORCEMENT
#   predicate it is unsound, because it exempts a file that merely MENTIONS
#   init.sh. A three-state probe (BL-181) showed one added comment line flips
#   this lint FAIL -> PASS with zero executable change, and the real repo had
#   a test exempted by the comment "We bypass init.sh (and its
#   --non-interactive cost) by hand-rolling the …" — a comment stating the
#   file does NOT invoke init.sh was what exempted it from the requirement.
#   The predicate below therefore looks at EXECUTED lines only. It needs BOTH
#   stages, because a shell comment has two spellings and stripping only one
#   leaves the defect alive in the other:
#     • `grep -vE '^[[:space:]]*#'` drops WHOLE-LINE comments at any indent —
#       the `[[:space:]]*` is load-bearing, since an indented comment is the
#       dominant form inside a function or if-block body;
#     • the `sed` then drops a TRAILING comment (`code   # note`) — without it
#       the identical comment TEXT still exempted the file merely by moving to
#       the end of an executable line, which is verbatim the BL-181 defect.
#   The sed deliberately requires a NON-SPACE char before the whitespace run,
#   so it fires only on a real trailing comment and never on a whole-line one
#   (that stays the grep's job, and keeps the grep's `[[:space:]]*` testable).
#   NOTE this half of the lint is deliberately STRICTER about what counts as a
#   comment than _build_registered_set, whose documented contract counts an
#   inline trailing comment as a real aggregator reference. The two halves
#   answer different questions and their safe directions differ; do not
#   "unify" them without re-deriving both contracts.
#
# RESIDUAL — KNOWN AND ACCEPTED, NOT A SILENT GAP.
#   Stripping comments does NOT catch an `init.sh` mention that lives inside a
#   quoted string or a heredoc body (e.g. a fixture that WRITES the token into
#   a generated file); nor a comment introduced with no preceding whitespace
#   (`foo;#note`), which the sed's non-space-then-space guard skips. Such a
#   file is still exempted even though it never executes init.sh. Note the
#   sed's own error direction is the LOUD one: a `#` inside a quoted string can
#   over-strip the rest of the line, which can only ever REMOVE hits and so
#   DEMANDS the file into the unit lane — a red lint a human reads, never a
#   silent exemption. (Measured at the time of the fix: over-stripping
#   reclassified zero files in tests/.) Two things bound the residual:
#     • it is conservative in the safe direction only for real invokers — a
#       wrongly-exempted file is a test that quietly stays out of the fast
#       lane, the exact BL-181 failure mode, just much rarer;
#     • so every DECISIVE exemption (the file is exempted AND is absent from
#       the unit list, i.e. the exemption actually changed the outcome) is
#       rendered in --list as `unit-lane-exempt:init-sh-invoker`. The
#       decision is reviewable instead of silent. An exempted file that is in
#       the unit list anyway decided nothing and is not rendered.
#   Closing the residual properly needs a shell-aware parse, which is out of
#   proportion to the risk; the --list surface is the compensating control.
#
# WHY `grep -c` AND NOT `… | grep -q` — SIGPIPE + pipefail, MEASURED HERE.
#   This script runs under `set -uo pipefail` (top of file). The obvious form
#       grep -vE '^[[:space:]]*#' "$file" | grep -q 'init\.sh'
#   is BROKEN under pipefail: `grep -q` exits the instant it matches, the
#   upstream `grep -vE` is still writing, it dies of SIGPIPE (rc 141), and
#   pipefail promotes that to the pipeline's status — so a file that DOES
#   invoke init.sh is reported as "no match" and wrongly DEMANDED. It is
#   size-dependent, so it looks fine on small fixtures and misfires on real
#   test files: measured on this repo, tests/test-bl112-commit-enforcement.sh
#   (a genuine init.sh scaffolder) gave rc=141 with `grep -q` and count=4 with
#   `grep -c`. `grep -c` consumes all of its input (as does the `sed` stage
#   between them), so nothing upstream ever sees a closed pipe and the
#   predicate is deterministic regardless of file size. Do NOT "simplify" this
#   back to `grep -q`, and keep every added stage a full-input consumer.
