# scripts/lint-backlog-references.sh — fail CI when commits and backlog
# entries drift apart. This is the process-discipline mirror of PR #72's
# counter-antipattern lint (Slot-4 of cycle 7 introduced the latter as
# the wave-2 backstop after counter-sanitizer remediation; this is the
# Slot-5 sibling that backstops backlog-citation hygiene).
#
# THE THREE DEFECT CLASSES
#
# 1. Unknown BL reference in a commit message.
#    A commit subject or body cites `BL-NNN` (e.g. `fix(init): host-
#    agnostic exit-3 attestation flow (BL-031)`) but no entry header
#    `## BL-NNN:` exists in solo-orchestrator-backlog.md. Catches typos
#    (`BL-31` vs `BL-031`), copy-paste from sibling repos, and stale
#    references to BLs that were merged into other entries.
#
# 2. `Closed`/`Resolved` backlog entry with no PR# or commit-SHA cite.
#    The entry block (from `## BL-NNN:` header to the next `---` or
#    next `## BL-` header) was flipped to Closed but reviewers can't
#    trace back to the merge. Acceptable cite forms inside the block:
#      - `PR #42` anywhere in the block
#      - a backticked commit SHA `` `1a2b3c4` `` (7-40 hex chars)
#    The status line itself can be either pattern Karl has used:
#      - `**Status:** Resolved (DATE, PR #N)` (early convention)
#      - `**Status:** Closed` + a separate `**Closed:** DATE — commit
#        `SHA` ...` line (later convention)
#      - `**Status:** Closed — shipped DATE (PR #N).` (current convention)
#    The check is structural — any of these satisfy as long as a PR# or
#    SHA appears somewhere in the entry block.
#
# 3. Duplicate `## BL-NNN:` entry header (BL-207).
#    The same ID owns two (or more) entry headers, so `BL-NNN` stops
#    being a unique key — grep, the citation primitive, and this
#    script's own block splitter all resolve ambiguously. See the
#    `# BL-207-HEADER-UNIQUENESS` arm below for the decisions.
#
# DELIBERATE SCOPE
#   • Targets ONLY solo-orchestrator-backlog.md (the canonical backlog).
#     Other docs (Reports/, docs/) can mention BL-NNN in prose without
#     constraint — they're not the source of truth.
#   • Commit-history walk uses `git log <BASE>..HEAD --pretty=%s%n%b`
#     so the lint is BASE-relative. CI sets BASE to `origin/${base_ref}`;
#     local runs default to `origin/main`. Override with `--base <ref>`.
#   • Tokens are matched case-insensitively against the regex
#     `BL-[0-9]+[a-z]?` (supports the `BL-003a` / `BL-003b` suffix
#     splits introduced in cycle 5). Sub-IDs are normalized to upper-
#     case before lookup so `bl-031` in a commit subject resolves
#     correctly. The valid-ID set is built ONCE from the backlog
#     using the literal entry-header regex `^## BL-[0-9]+[a-z]?:`.
#   • Branch-scoped token allowlist: if ANY commit in the BASE..HEAD
#     range contains a `lint-backlog-references-ignore: <CSV>` footer
#     (case-insensitive, comma-separated, anywhere in the message),
#     those tokens are skipped from the unknown-ref check ACROSS THE
#     ENTIRE BASE..HEAD range. Scope is branch-wide (not per-commit)
#     so a clean-up commit can retroactively exempt placeholder tokens
#     mentioned in an earlier commit on the same branch (otherwise an
#     amend-or-rewrite would be required to fix prose). Use this when
#     a commit LEGITIMATELY mentions a placeholder ID — test fixtures,
#     sample diagnostics in a CHANGELOG entry, or this very script's
#     own header — without intending to reference a real backlog item.
#   • Citations are required ONLY for entries whose status block
#     contains "Closed" or "Resolved" (case-sensitive — these are the
#     two terms Karl uses; "open"/"in-progress"/"wontfix"/"promoted-
#     to-spec" don't require citations).
#
# ALLOWLIST
#   For entries closed before the citation convention existed, append
#   `<!-- lint-backlog-references: allow <reason> -->` to the
#   `**Status:**` line itself. The reason is REQUIRED — empty reason
#   fails the lint, matching PR #72's allowlist semantics.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 — no violations
#   1 — one or more violations found
#   2 — invocation / I/O error
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/lint-backlog-references.sh                      # quiet pass/fail
#   bash scripts/lint-backlog-references.sh --base origin/main   # explicit base

#     --message "feat: do thing (BL-031)"                        # gate use
#   echo "feat: x (BL-031)" \                                    # OR pipe the
#     | bash scripts/lint-backlog-references.sh --pre-commit-mode #   message
#
# PRE-COMMIT MODE
#   Skips Step 2 (the BASE..HEAD commit-message walk) — there is no
#   commit yet at pre-commit time, so `git log` would be a no-op or,
#   worse, walk historical commits the operator can't fix from this
#   commit. Instead, the prospective commit message is supplied via
#   `--message <text>` or stdin and scanned for `BL-NNN` tokens.
#   Steps 3 and 4 (backlog-block scan for Closed/Resolved without
#   citation; entry-header uniqueness) run unchanged — both are
#   structural on the backlog file, independent of git history. This is
#   the contract scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh relies on when invoking the
#   lint at commit time.
#   If the backlog file does NOT exist, pre-commit mode exits 0 with no
#   output instead of the FATAL below: init.sh ships this lint into
#   generated projects, which have no backlog by design (BUG-008 — see
#   `# BUG-008-SHIPPED-TREE-PASS`). Every other mode still treats a
#   missing backlog as fatal.

# ── BUG-008-SHIPPED-TREE-PASS-BEGIN ──────────────────────────────────
# An ABSENT backlog means two opposite things depending on the mode, so
# the existence check is mode-aware rather than unconditional.
#
#   --pre-commit-mode → NORMAL. init.sh ships this lint into every
#     generated project (the `cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/
#     lint-backlog-references.sh" scripts/` line, since 2026-07-17), and
#     the shipped scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh `lints_check` pipes every
#     AI-issued `git commit -m` message through it in this mode. A
#     generated project has NO solo-orchestrator-backlog.md by design —
#     that ledger is the framework repo's own. There is nothing on this
#     tree to validate the message's BL tokens against, so the only
#     correct verdict is "not this tree's concern": exit 0, and — on the
#     gate's own flagless invocation — not one byte on either stream, so
#     its `br_out=$(... 2>&1)` capture stays empty.
#
#     BUG-008: before this arm the FATAL below ran FIRST in every mode.
#     That invocation exited 2, and lints_check turned the nonzero into
#     a PreToolUse DENY offering SKIP_LINT=1 — a generated-project
#     user's first plain `-m` commit was blocked outright. It went
#     unseen through July because the dogfood walks committed via
#     heredoc, which yields an empty extracted message that lints_check
#     skips as the editor case.
#
#   any other mode → CATASTROPHE, unchanged. In the FRAMEWORK repo the
#     backlog is the ledger this lint exists to police; CI's BASE..HEAD
#     walk, the Closed/Resolved citation scan and the header-uniqueness
#     arm all require the file. Passing silently there would convert the
#     repo's own citation gate into a no-op, so the FATAL stays.
#
# --list still renders the verdict (house rule: a decisive judgement is
# reviewable, never silent-on-pass). The gate never passes --list, so
# this cannot put output back on the DENY-bearing path.

# ── Step 4: entry-header UNIQUENESS ────────────────────────────────
# BL-207-HEADER-UNIQUENESS
#
# Every `BL-NNN` must own exactly ONE `^## BL-NNN:` header. Uniqueness
# is what makes the ID grep-able as this repo's citation primitive, and
# Step 3's block splitter assumes it: a second header for the same ID
# truncates the first block and opens a second one, so the citation
# check silently evaluates the wrong text. Structural on the file, so
# it runs in BOTH modes (like Step 3) — an operator adding a duplicate
# header is blocked at commit time, not only in CI.
#
# THREE DECISIONS, each pinned by a test in
# tests/test-lint-backlog-references.sh:
#
#   • NO exemption for preserved `Original entry (pre-close, kept for
#     audit trail):` blocks (T16). A duplicate is a duplicate wherever
#     it appears: the splitter above already reads an un-indented
#     `^## BL-NNN:` line inside such a block as a real entry header, so
#     exempting it here would make this arm disagree with the very
#     splitter it protects, and the audit-trail block would silently
#     capture the ID. Quoting a header inside an entry body is still
#     fine, but INDENT it (T15) — awk is fence-blind, so a ```-fenced
#     header still sitting at column 0 is counted, exactly as the
#     splitter counts it. Only leading whitespace exempts.
#
#   • HEADERS ONLY, anchored (T15). Prose cross-references
#     ("supersedes BL-050") repeat by design and are never violations;
#     only the anchored header form is a key.
#
#   • The ID grammar is `BL-[0-9]+[a-z]?`, identical to Step 1's
#     valid-ID builder (T17). The narrower `^## BL-[0-9]+:` from the
#     BL-207 sketch would go blind to the `BL-003a` / `BL-003b` suffix
#     splits; the suffix is part of the ID, so those three are distinct
#     keys and must not be folded together. No case folding is applied
#     (unlike the commit-token path): the header regex only matches an
#     upper-case `BL-` with a lower-case suffix, so folding could not
#     merge anything and would only distort the ID in the diagnostic,
#     which reviewers grep for verbatim.
#
# NOT COVERED (known residuals, so the scope is readable here and not
# only in the review record):
#   • `## code-*-N:` headers in this same file (two exist as of
#     2026-07-31: `## code-upgrade-project-8:` and
#     `## code-check-gates-1:`) — this arm keys on `BL-` IDs only, which
#     matches the rest of the lint's scope. A duplicate `code-*` header
#     is not caught.
#   • `## BUG-NNN:` headers in solo-orchestrator-bugs.md (7 today) —
#     that file is never opened by this lint (DELIBERATE SCOPE above
#     targets only the canonical backlog), so BUG IDs have no
#     uniqueness guard at all.
#   • BL-093: when the archive split lands, this arm must span BOTH
#     files — an ID present in the main backlog AND the archive is the
#     same defect.
#
# ONE awk pass emits both records: a `TOTAL` line (the header count, for
# the --list row) and a `DUP` line per duplicated ID. Deriving the total
# here rather than from a second `grep -c … || true` capture is
# deliberate — that capture is exactly the counter antipattern
# scripts/lint-counter-antipattern.sh exists to reject (it caught this
# during development). Duplicates are emitted in FIRST-HEADER order via
# the `order[]` index, not `for (k in seen)`, so output is deterministic
# without a `| sort` (awk's `in` iteration order is unspecified).
