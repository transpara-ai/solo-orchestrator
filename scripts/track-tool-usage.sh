# Solo Orchestrator — post-tool hook for MCP tool usage tracking
# Logs Context7, Qdrant, and any configured MCP tool calls to .claude/tool-usage.json.
# Updates compliance state for the session-mcp-gate.sh PreToolUse enforcement hook.
# Fires after every tool call — must be fast for non-MCP tools.
#
# ── BL-233: this hook records OUTCOMES, not DECLARATIONS ────────────────────
# It used to set `qdrant_find_called = true` / `context7_called = true` from the
# TOOL NAME alone. A qdrant-find that connected to nothing and returned
# "All connection attempts failed" therefore satisfied the session gate exactly
# as a working one did (BL-231), and a Context7 ID lookup that fetches no
# documentation satisfied a gate whose stated purpose is that documentation was
# read (BL-232). Both are the same substitution: was a matching tool CALLED,
# rather than did the call WORK.
#
# ── GROUND TRUTH, measured 2026-08-13 (the docs carry no worked MCP example) ─
# Captured by registering a probe on both events and firing one failing and one
# succeeding MCP call:
#
#   A FAILED MCP CALL FIRES `PostToolUseFailure`. IT DOES NOT FIRE `PostToolUse`.
#
#   | field         | success (PostToolUse)                 | failure (PostToolUseFailure) |
#   |---------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
#   | tool_response | PRESENT — array of MCP content blocks | ABSENT                       |
#   | error         | absent                                | "Error calling tool '…': …"  |
#   | is_interrupt  | —                                     | false                        |
#   | isError       | NONE ANYWHERE — MCP's own isError is not preserved by either event     |
#
# So THE EVENT IS THE SIGNAL: there is no field to test for success, and this
# hook must be registered on BOTH events or failures are not miscounted — they
# are INVISIBLE. (BL-233's own text says "read .tool_response". That is wrong:
# tool_response tells you what came BACK, not that the call worked. What it is
# genuinely good for is the separate question of whether the result was EMPTY,
# which is why the empty-retrieval arm below reads it and the outcome arm does
# not. The entry is corrected as part of WP-A.)
#
# A THIRD STATE exists: a call rejected before execution (unknown tool, schema
# validation) fires NEITHER event. It is scored `unknown` and satisfies nothing,
# which under fail-closed is correct — but it must never look like success.
#
# Registration (init.sh, and this repo's .claude/settings.json):
#   PostToolUse:        bash …/track-tool-usage.sh --event PostToolUse
#   PostToolUseFailure: bash …/track-tool-usage.sh --event PostToolUseFailure
# The --event argument is belt-and-braces: the payload's own hook_event_name is
# used when the argument is absent, and a DISAGREEMENT between the two — the
# shape a mis-registration pointing both events at PostToolUse produces — is
# scored `unknown` rather than trusted.
#
# Don't use set -e — this is an advisory post-tool hook that must NEVER block
# the agent's work. If tool-usage.json is corrupted or jq fails, the agent
# continues working and tool tracking silently degrades. This is intentional:
# a tracking failure should not interrupt a build loop or any other operation.
# The enforcement half of the split lives in session-mcp-gate.sh, which fails
# CLOSED for exactly the states this hook shrugs off. Tracker never blocks;
# gate always fails closed.

#
#     D8 empty result returns 200 with {games: [], meta.total: 0}

# while handing it a full one.

# manufactures a false alarm about the exact thing the operator was told to
# trust, and it does so on a payload that contains real retrieved context.
