# scripts/delta.sh — the post-1.0 delta track's operator front door.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §10.1 (THE ERA INVARIANT —
# `active_delta != null => current_phase == 4`, and this file is its LOAD-BEARING
# enforcement point), §7.1 (the state schema, the single-writer rule, and
# `gates_required` materialised AT OPEN), §4.1–§4.3 (the four classes, the
# derived-then-confirmed attributes, confirm-not-quiz), §5.2 (the per-class gate
# subset the materialisation produces), §6.1 (this is the GUIDED creation path),
# §3.1 (a member of the severable delta module), §11-WP3.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose — no backlog
# entry exists for this build, and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the
# WP1/WP2 precedent. The grep-able `DELTA-OPEN-*` markers below are this file's
# citation primitive and its mutation addresses.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, IN ONE PARAGRAPH
#
# After a project ships 1.0 it never goes back through Phases 0–3. Everything
# after that is a DELTA: a feature, a fix, a hotfix, or a security patch. This
# script opens one. It asks the operator a single question, having already
# proposed every answer from what they typed and from what the repository can
# measure — and it refuses, loudly, in the two situations where opening a delta
# would quietly destroy something.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE TWO REFUSALS, AND WHY EACH ONE EARNS ITS EXIT CODE
#
# 1. THE ERA INVARIANT (§10.1) — `# DELTA-OPEN-ERA-GUARD`, exit 3.
#    `--open` refuses unless `.claude/phase-state.json::current_phase` is
#    EXACTLY 4. §10.1 calls this "the load-bearing one — it is what makes the
#    delta track unable to substitute for building the product properly." A
#    project at phase 2 that could open a delta has discovered a way to do
#    post-release maintenance ceremony INSTEAD of building the product, and the
#    ceremony is cheaper, so it would win.
#
#    READ THE `[WARN]` TRAP BEFORE TOUCHING THIS (CLAUDE.md, and §10.1 repeats
#    it). In check-phase-gate.sh the `[WARN]`/`[FAIL]` text is COSMETIC — the
#    exit predicate is `if [ $issues -eq 0 ]`, so two arms that print the same
#    label can have opposite gate outcomes. The lesson generalises to here: what
#    makes this a refusal is the NON-ZERO RETURN, not the red word next to it.
#    tests/test-delta-wp3-era-classify.sh asserts the exit CODE, never the
#    label, and its m1 mutation neuters this one line to prove the code moves.
#
# 2. THE SECOND-ACTIVATION REFUSAL (§7.1) — `# DELTA-OPEN-ACTIVE-GUARD`, exit 4.
#    WP2 DEFERRED THIS TO HERE, in as many words: scripts/lib/delta-state.sh's
#    "WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ENFORCE" block says overwriting an OPEN
#    active_delta is accepted at the state layer, that §11-WP3 owns open/confirm
#    and therefore owns the business refusal, and that one-at-a-time is only
#    STRUCTURAL until then. This is that refusal, and it is where it belongs:
#    the schema's single `active_delta` slot means a second open would not fail —
#    it would SUCCEED and silently discard the first delta's `gates_completed`,
#    which is the audit trail of everything already done. A refusal that names
#    the open delta is the only outcome that leaves the operator informed.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE SINGLE-WRITER RULE (D7), AND WHAT IT COSTS THIS FILE
#
# `.claude/delta-state.json` has exactly ONE writer: scripts/process-checklist.sh
# (§7.1). This script NEVER touches it — not to read, not to write. Every state
# operation routes through the seam's `--delta-*` actions. That is more
# indirection than a direct `jq` would need, and it is bought deliberately: the
# guard lives in the seam, and a second writer is a guard that can be forgotten.
# scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh makes the rule checkable, with a seam allowlist
# whose cardinality is asserted at exactly one.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CONFIRM, DO NOT QUIZ (§4.3) — the `# BL-204-PREFILL` pattern
#
# The repo's reference implementation is `# BL-204-PREFILL` in
# scripts/intake-wizard.sh: read the remembered answer, PRINT it, print WHY
# re-asking would be wrong, and ask the operator to keep or change. This
# transcript copies it exactly, with one addition §4.3 insists on — every one of
# the four lines names WHERE ITS VALUE CAME FROM, "because a proposal whose
# provenance is hidden is a quiz with extra steps." The provenance text is not
# written here; it is returned alongside each value by
# scripts/lib/delta-classify.sh, so a caller cannot print the value and drop the
# reason.
#
# RAISES ARE FREE, LOWERS ARE REASON-RECORDED (§4.2). The operator may raise
# `risk` to core, `level` to evolution, or `severity` toward SEV-1 with no
# justification at all — they know things the formula does not. Going the other
# way removes a gate, so it records a reason into the delta's own row. A lower
# with no reason available (a scripted run with no `--reason`) is REFUSED rather
# than recorded blank: a blank reason is indistinguishable from a raise nobody
# noticed, three months later, in the audit tail.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# OPERATOR-FACING TEXT IS PLAIN ENGLISH ON PURPOSE
# §4.3's transcript is the register for everything this script prints. No
# framework jargon, no file paths in the confirm flow, no "invariant". The
# person reading it has just shipped a product and wants to fix a bug.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE CLOSE FLOW (WP4) — FIVE REFUSALS, IN THIS ORDER, AND WHY THE ORDER IS THE
# DESIGN
#
# `--close` walks the delta's own record and refuses at the first thing that is
# not true. The ORDER is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
#
#   1. NOTHING OPEN                    exit 6.  Nothing to reason about.
#   2. UNKNOWN GATE TOKEN              exit 9.  A configuration error, and it
#      goes FIRST among the substantive checks because it is the only one whose
#      answer cannot be trusted otherwise: if a token is meaningless, so is
#      "outstanding" and so is "complete". It fails CLOSED and writes nothing.
#   3. CLOSE-TIME RE-DERIVATION        exit 10 (only when it appends).
#      §4.2: the open-time derivation was a FORECAST; this measures the real
#      diff. A higher bracket RAISES the attribute and APPENDS the gates that
#      raise toggles on. It never lowers. It runs BEFORE the outstanding-gates
#      check because the whole point is that the checklist may have grown —
#      running it after would let a delta opened `small` and grown into an auth
#      rewrite close on the small checklist, which is §11-WP4's own mutation.
#   4. GATES OUTSTANDING               exit 7.  gates_required minus
#      gates_completed, named.
#   5. THE RUBRIC BIND                 exit 8.  §5.3's strongest sentence: "the
#      brief's acceptance criteria ARE the close review's rubric". It runs LAST
#      because it needs the brief to exist, and `brief` is itself a gate that
#      step 4 is still able to be waiting on.
#
# REFUSAL RESIDUE — THE STANDARD THIS FILE'S OPEN FLOW SET, SCOPED TO WHAT
# EXECUTION ACTUALLY SHOWS.
#
# READ THIS AS A PROPERTY OF THE RAISE, NOT OF THE EXIT CODE. An earlier version
# of this block said "for 6/7/8/9 that sentence is true of the WHOLE TREE", and
# an adversarial review REFUTED it by execution. The refutation is worth keeping
# because the mistake is the natural one to make: the ratchet writes whenever an
# attribute ROSE, while exit 10 fires only when a gate was ALSO APPENDED, and
# those are different conditions. A raise that toggles nothing — small ->
# significant, which no toggle answers; or risk -> core on a class already
# carrying brief_review — records itself and then falls through to the exit-7 or
# exit-8 refusal. So:
#
#   6 and 9   ALWAYS leave the whole tree pristine. 6 returns before anything is
#             measured, and 9 is ordered BEFORE the ratchet precisely so that a
#             configuration error can never write. N1 pins both.
#   7 and 8   leave the tree pristine WHEN NO RAISE OCCURRED (N1), and carry
#             exactly the bounded ratchet record when one did (N3, N4).
#   10        always carries that record, by construction (N2).
#
# THE RECORD IS BOUNDED, IDEMPOTENT AND ANNOUNCED, and those three are what make
# the exception safe rather than merely admitted. Bounded: it touches the
# delta's own `attributes`, `gates_required` and `ratcheted_at`, and nothing
# else anywhere — asserted in both directions by N2/N3/N4. Idempotent: a second
# close re-measures to the same bracket and writes nothing at all, so the record
# cannot accrete one stamp per attempt. Announced: the transcript names the
# old -> new value every time, so the operator is never the last to know their
# own record moved.
#
# The alternative — announce the new obligations without recording them — was
# rejected: the operator would be told about a larger checklist the record does
# not contain, and every subsequent close would re-announce it as news. §4.2 is
# explicit that the raise is recorded.
#
# GATES ARE ATTESTED, AND THE HELP TEXT MUST NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. §5.3 tiers
# the review honestly: the rubric is MECHANICAL, the reviewer is ADVISORY.
# `--complete-gate` records that the OPERATOR SAYS a gate is satisfied. The
# framework does not verify that the adversarial review happened, that the
# changelog entry is under the right heading, or that the repro test was RED
# first. The two things it does check itself are the two this WP makes real: the
# brief's done-observable boxes, and the close-time re-measurement of size and
# risk. Do not widen the wording beyond those two.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE HOTFIX FAST LANE AND THE RETRO LEDGER (WP5) — §5.2's LOAN
#
# A hotfix ships on the floor (§5.1: gitleaks, semgrep, project tests, TDD
# ordering — all four already shipped, in the generated hook and in
# pre-commit-gate.sh) plus an audit row, and NOTHING heavier: no brief, no
# pre-build review, no Build Loop. The delta track adds NO floor arm and no
# second copy of any of them.
#
# §5.2 is careful about what that is: "The hotfix lane ships on the floor alone
# plus an audit row. It does not skip review — it DEFERS it, by exactly 3 days
# (Karl set 3, not 7), and the deferral is COLLATERALISED: cut-release.sh
# refuses while any retro is open (§9.2). That is what makes the fast lane a
# loan rather than a leak." Everything below follows from reading that as a
# loan:
#
#   THE AUDIT ROW IS WRITTEN AT OPEN — `# DELTA-OPEN-AUDIT-ROW`. The token is
#   spelled `audit_row_at_open` and it means it. The stamp goes on the delta's
#   own record in the SAME atomic write that opens it, and the gate is recorded
#   COMPLETE at that moment. It is the one gate in the system nobody attests,
#   because the framework wrote it rather than asking — which is exactly what
#   distinguishes it from `ledger_row`, the operator's own BUGS.md row, which
#   stays attested like every other class's. A hotfix that is never closed still
#   left its trace.
#
#   THE OBLIGATION IS BOOKED AT OPEN — `# DELTA-OPEN-RETRO-APPEND`. One row in
#   `hotfix_retros[]`, §7.1's five keys exactly, `due_by = shipped_at +
#   classes.hotfix.retro_due_days` read from policy. Booked at open and not at
#   close, because a hotfix that never reaches its close is precisely the one
#   whose write-up nobody would otherwise be waiting for.
#
#   AND THE LEDGER OUTLIVES THE CLOSE — `# DELTA-CLOSE-ATOMIC-WRITE`. §7.1:
#   "`hotfix_retros` is an array and outlives `active_delta` deliberately: an
#   open retro must block a release cut long after its delta closed." The close
#   filter touches `.closed` and `.active_delta` and NOTHING ELSE. If closing
#   the delta also closed the retro, the loan would be forgiven the instant it
#   was taken out — and every visible surface would still say the right thing.
#   That is the defect tests/test-delta-wp5-hotfix-retro.sh's m2 builds.
#
#   `retro_review` IS SATISFIED BY THE OBLIGATION, NOT BY A TICK-BOX —
#   `# DELTA-CLOSE-RETRO-BIND` and `# DELTA-GATE-RETRO-NOT-ATTESTABLE`. §7.2:
#   "hotfix has no `close_review` because `retro_review` carries it … a separate
#   `close_review` token on the hotfix row would either double-charge the review
#   or, worse, let a hotfix satisfy `close_review` at ship time and make the
#   retro optional — which is precisely the loan going unrepaid." So
#   `--complete-gate retro_review` is REFUSED, and the close waives the token
#   when — and only when — this delta's row is on the ledger. No row, no waiver:
#   an obligation nobody is holding is not a deferral, it is a disappearance,
#   and the close fails CLOSED (exit 7) rather than archiving a hotfix with no
#   collateral behind it.
#
# WHY THE CLOSE IS ALLOWED TO SUCCEED WITH THE RETRO STILL OPEN, spelled out
# because the opposite reading is the tempting one: a close that refused until
# the retro was filed would hold the single `active_delta` slot for three days,
# so the 3am operator who just shipped a hotfix could not open ANYTHING else
# until they had written it up. That trades the fast lane away to enforce the
# repayment, when §9.2 already enforces it at the only place that matters — the
# release. The debt is announced at close, surfaced by `--status`, and called in
# by `cut-release.sh`.
#
# THE INCIDENT-RESPONSE SEAM (§5.2) — DO NOT FUSE THE TWO CLOCKS.
# `templates/generated/incident-response.tmpl` already owns the SEV→response
# chain (Immediate / 1 h / 4 h / next window), the escalation rule, and a
# post-incident review "within 48 hours of resolution" filed at
# `docs/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. None of it is duplicated here. The two
# clocks differ ON PURPOSE and neither is wrong: 48 h governs the INCIDENT
# write-up, `retro_due_days` governs the CODE retro. §7.2 makes both readable
# from one place so a project can align them if it wants — that alignment is the
# project's decision, not the framework's, so this flow neither reads the
# template nor teaches the template to read the policy.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE RUBRIC PARSE CONTRACT (§5.3/§6.2) — WP8's template must match this
#
# The brief is `docs/deltas/DELTA-NNN-slug.md` (§6.3). This flow reads exactly
# one section of it:
#
#   • A RUBRIC SECTION is opened by ANY heading whose text begins
#     `Done-observable`, case-insensitively, at any heading depth
#     (`## Done-observable`, and a trailing parenthetical is fine). It ENDS at
#     the next heading of the same depth or shallower — so a `### Nice-to-have`
#     subsection inside it is still part of the rubric, and the next `## …` is
#     not. A brief carrying TWO such headings has BOTH read, and the criteria
#     are pooled.
#     THIS SENTENCE USED TO SAY "the FIRST heading" and the code disagreed with
#     it; an adversarial review found the mismatch by execution. The SENTENCE
#     moved, not the code, and deliberately: the implementation is the stricter
#     of the two readings, and a criterion the operator wrote under a second
#     Done-observable heading is still a criterion — a first-only reader would
#     have ignored it and closed. B5 pins both directions so it cannot drift
#     back. WP8's template codifies THIS wording.
#   • A CRITERION is a list item whose marker is `-`, `*` or `+`, at any indent,
#     followed by a bracketed single character: `- [x]` / `- [X]` is CHECKED,
#     `- [ ]` is NOT. Anything else between the brackets is treated as NOT
#     checked and named — an undefined marker is a criterion nobody has decided
#     about, and guessing in the permissive direction is how a rubric quietly
#     stops being one.
#   • ONLY that section is read. Checkboxes under What / Must-not-change /
#     Touched surfaces are ignored, which is pinned in both directions (the
#     refusal never names them; a brief whose rubric is fully checked closes
#     even though other sections carry unchecked boxes).
#   • IT FAILS CLOSED. No brief file, two files matching the id, no
#     Done-observable section, or a section containing NO checkboxes at all are
#     each a refusal. A rubric that cannot be read is not a rubric that passed —
#     and the zero-checkbox case is the one worth naming, because it is the
#     shape a brief takes when the section heading was copied from the template
#     and never filled in.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES — CODES, NEVER LABELS
#   0  the delta was opened or closed, a gate was recorded, or `--status`
#      reported successfully
#   1  an operation failed (the seam refused a write, jq is missing, …)
#   2  invocation error: bad flag, missing argument, a gate this delta does not
#      owe, or a confirmation that could not be obtained (no terminal and no
#      `--confirm`)
#   3  ERA REFUSAL — the project is not at phase 4          (§10.1)
#   4  SECOND-ACTIVATION REFUSAL — a delta is already open  (§7.1)
#   5  an attribute was LOWERED with no reason recorded     (§4.2)
#   6  there is nothing open to close or to record against  (§7.1)
#   7  required gates are still outstanding                 (§5.2)
#   8  the brief's rubric has an unchecked or unreadable criterion  (§5.3)
#   9  an unknown gate token — a configuration error, failing CLOSED (§5.2)
#  10  the close-time re-measurement RAISED an attribute and added obligations,
#      so the close refuses on the LARGER checklist          (§4.2)
#  11  `--retro` names an id no retro on the record carries  (§7.1)
#  12  that retro is already filed — the write-up is WRITE-ONCE, for the same
#      reason `shipped_in` is (§7.1): overwriting it would destroy the only
#      record of what was decided at the time
#
# There is NO era refusal on `--close`, and that is a decision. §10.1 places the
# invariant's enforcement at OPEN (load-bearing) and in scripts/validate.sh
# (report-only). An `active_delta` at phase < 4 is already the inconsistency
# validate.sh reports, and closing it is the ONLY path back to a consistent
# record — a close that refused there would strand the delta permanently in the
# state the invariant forbids. Pinned by W3.

#
# WP8 IS WHERE A USER STRING BECOMES A FILESYSTEM PATH, and that is why the
# refusal lives here rather than anywhere earlier. WP3's adversarial review
# recorded `--slug ../../../etc/cron.d/evil` stored VERBATIM: harmless at the
# time, because WP3 only ever wrote it into JSON. This work package composes
# `docs/deltas/<id>-<slug>.md` out of it, so the same string is now a write
# target.
#
# WHY REFUSE AND NOT JUST SANITISE. `_slugify` would in fact flatten every one
# of these to something harmless — but silently, and the operator would find
# their delta under a name they did not choose with no idea why. Worse, a
# future edit that composed the path before slugifying (or slugified with a
# looser expression) would re-open the hole with nothing failing. A refusal is
# a fact the operator can see and a line a mutation can kill; sanitisation
# alone is a property that has to keep being true. So it is BOTH: refuse the
# path-shaped spellings loudly, sanitise everything else.
#
# The four spellings are one class and are matched as one, because a guard that
# catches `../` and misses `..\` or a leading `.` is not a guard:
#   */*      any separator, which covers `/etc/passwd` and `a/../b`
#   *\\*     a Windows separator
#   *..*     a traversal segment anywhere, even without a separator
#   .*       a leading dot: `.hidden`, `.` and `..` all land here
# An EMPTY slug is accepted — it means the operator did not pass `--slug` at
# all, and the description is slugified instead.
#
# THE FIFTH SPELLING IS NOT A SEPARATOR AT ALL (review R-WP8-3). A NEWLINE
# passes every pattern above — it is not `/`, not `\`, not `..`, not a leading
# dot — and `_slugify` PRESERVES it, because sed is line-oriented and processes
# each half independently. The composed name `docs/deltas/$id-$slug.md` then
# carries an embedded newline. No traversal and no injection is reachable
# through it (each half is still reduced to [a-z0-9-], the ledger cell strips
# `\n\r|`, and the state value goes through `jq --arg`), so this is robustness
# rather than security — but a file whose name contains a line break is a file
# the operator cannot type, and the guard is the honest place to say no.
#
# `tr -d '[:cntrl:]'` and not a pattern: it covers tab and carriage return by
# the same stroke, and it leaves accented UTF-8 bytes alone — those are not
# control characters, and `_slugify` already folds them to a hyphen, so a slug
# like "Café Export" should be SANITISED rather than refused. Note the command
# substitution strips trailing newlines from its own output, which is why a
# slug that merely ENDS in a newline also compares unequal and is refused.

#
#   THE CONTRACT IS "ECHO NOTHING UNLESS THE ROW LANDED", AND BOTH BRANCHES MUST
#   HONOUR IT. The caller distinguishes "no ledger here" from "the write did not
#   complete" by asking whether the file exists — and that discrimination only
#   works if a failed write actually produces the empty result it is looking for.
#   The BUGS branch got `|| return 0` when that discrimination was added; the
#   FEATURE branch did not, and its unguarded `} >> "$ledger"` fell straight
#   through to the `printf` below, returning the FILENAME on failure. So a
#   read-only FEATURES.md produced: rc 0, "A row for DELTA-001 is on
#   FEATURES.md", `grep -c DELTA-001` = 0, and `ledger: "FEATURES.md"` recorded

#   severity, the link — and the operator fills in the description and ticks
#   the gate. For a HOTFIX this same row is Karl's decision-3 audit trace: a
#   visible ledger row written the moment the fast lane opens, which survives

#
#   The recorded path wins when there is one: §11-WP8 owns the guided intake

#   WP8 AMENDMENT — THE AMBIGUITY CHECK NOW RUNS FIRST, AND UNCONDITIONALLY.
#   The recorded path still wins, but it no longer SKIPS the glob. Once WP8's
#   guided intake started filling `active_delta.brief`, an early return on the
#   recorded value made the two-files-claim-one-id refusal unreachable through
#   the front door: the close would review the framework's own render while the

#   happened to be complete, nothing anywhere would say so. Order matters here
#   and it is the only thing that changed — a delta that names its own brief is

# --retro — filing the write-up a hotfix owes (§5.2's repayment)
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# THE RECORD'S CONTRACT, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. `record` is an object with
# a `kind` and a `value`, and the kind is the honest part:
#
#   {"kind":"file","value":"docs/incidents/2026-08-03-checkout.md"}
#       the value named a file THAT EXISTS when this ran. The framework has not
#       read it and does not claim to — §5.3's tiering applies here exactly as
#       it does to every other gate — but it did check that there is something
#       at that path.
#   {"kind":"attested","value":"the gateway timed out; we retry twice now"}
#       anything else, including a path that did not resolve. A path stored as
#       `attested` is SAID to be, out loud, at the moment it is filed: a typo'd
#       filename recorded as though a document existed would be the framework
#       inventing evidence.
#
# WRITE-ONCE, for the same reason `shipped_in` is (§7.1): a second write-up
# claiming the same incident is a bug worth stopping, and overwriting the first
# would destroy the only record of what was decided at the time.
#
# THE RETRO IS FOUND ON THE LEDGER, NOT ON `active_delta` — it outlives its
# delta, so filing it must work long after the delta closed, and while a
# completely different delta is open.
