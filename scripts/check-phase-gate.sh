# ── Argv parser (BL-060) ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Adversarial cert re-walker-4 surfaced that scenarios invoke this
# script with `--gate phase_1_to_2` expecting the flag to scope the
# check to the named gate, but pre-fix the script had no argv parser
# at all — every arg was silently ignored, and the gate fired only
# because `current_phase=2` in phase-state.json coincidentally
# triggered the backstop. A future refactor of the backstop trigger
# would silently break `--gate` consumers.
#
# Contract:
#   --gate <name>   Force the named gate's checks to run regardless
#                   of current_phase, AND cap checks at that gate so
#                   HIGHER-phase gate blocks do not fire (strict scope).
#                   Valid names: phase_0_to_1, phase_1_to_2,
#                   phase_2_to_3, phase_3_to_4. Also accepts --gate=<v>.
#   --help, -h      Print usage and exit 0.
#
# Semantics for --gate:
#   Each gate crossing implies all prior gates have been crossed. So
#   `--gate phase_1_to_2` verifies Phase 0→1 evidence AND Phase 1→2
#   evidence, but skips Phase 2→3 and Phase 3→4 checks. Implementation:
#   override `current_phase` to the gate's TARGET phase.
#
# Exit codes:
#   2 — invalid argv (unknown gate, unknown flag, --gate given twice,
#       missing value). Diagnostics go to stderr.

Usage: check-phase-gate.sh [--gate <name>] [--help]

Reads .claude/phase-state.json and verifies APPROVAL_LOG.md has dated
entries for all completed phase gates.

Options:
  --gate <name>   Scope the check to the named gate. Forces the gate's
                  checks to run regardless of current_phase in
                  phase-state.json; caps at that gate (skips higher
                  gates). Valid names:
                    phase_0_to_1, phase_1_to_2,
                    phase_2_to_3, phase_3_to_4
                  Also accepts --gate=<name>.
  --help, -h      Show this message.

Exit codes:
  0 — all gates consistent (or phase-state.json not found w/o --gate)
  1 — inconsistency detected (SOIF_PHASE_GATES=warn downgrades to 0),
      OR --gate was specified but no phase-state.json fixture exists

# Historically nothing wrote that field — the gate only READ it (and

# APPROVAL_LOG.md evidence still showed "gate date not recorded". These
# helpers close that loop: on a gate whose APPROVAL_LOG.md dated
# evidence is present, we record today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) plus a
# sibling actor field, atomically and idempotently.

# Reuses the PR #97 / scripts/lib/bypass-audit.sh atomic-finalize

# contained in a subshell so it never clobbers a caller trap.

  #      full-string equality, not substring containment.
  #   2. The authoritative comparison source is the commit author of
  #      the most recent APPROVAL_LOG.md change. The ambient git
  #      user becomes a softer WARN signal when it matches the

# --- Phase 1→2 BACKSTOP: remote PUSH verification (BL-084) ---
# The protection backstop above proves branch PROTECTION; it does NOT prove
# the code was actually uploaded. This backstop verifies the remote really
# has the branch — the check that makes the verify-install "bring-your-own
# CI" warning TRUE rather than a mask for un-pushed code.
#
# SCOPE: this runs ONLY for host=="other" (the bring-your-own-host path).
# First-class hosts (github/gitlab/bitbucket) HARD-FAIL init on a push
# failure (create_and_protect_remote returns 1 → record_init_failure), so a
# first-class project that reached Phase 2 provably pushed at init; the
# protection backstop above (API verify) already re-confirms reachability.
# The 'other' path is the ONLY one where init can legitimately COMPLETE
# without a verified push — via the light-tier acknowledged escapes below —
# so it is exactly where a raw push-existence check adds real value.
#
# HERMETIC/testable: verification is a plain `git ls-remote --heads origin`
# — it works against a LOCAL bare repo (tests point origin there) and NEVER
# invokes gh/glab (BL-076: no real remote creation).
#
# TIER-aware, keyed on the ACTUAL project tier (deployment + poc_mode), NOT
# `track` — a POC-Sponsored / Production project can carry track=light
# non-interactively, so trusting `track` would let it bypass with no code
# pushed. This keying is IDENTICAL to init.sh::_bl084_tier_bypassable so the
# two enforcement points cannot disagree:
#   • NON-bypassable (POC-Sponsored / Production — deployment=organizational
#     OR poc_mode=sponsored_poc): a VERIFIED remote is MANDATORY — FAIL if the
#     remote does not have the code. No ack bypasses the push itself.
#   • BYPASSABLE (Personal / POC-Personal — deployment=personal AND
#     poc_mode≠sponsored_poc): require the verified remote UNLESS
#     local_only_acknowledged is on record (then PASS — operator opted out).
#     A push_deferred_acknowledged with no verified push still FAILs — the
#     deferral does NOT let them advance ("the gate WILL block you").
# The `# BL-084-PUSH-VERIFY` marker is a mutation-proof target (removing the
# verification flips the "deferred-but-not-pushed → FAIL" test RED); the
# `# BL-084-TIER-KEY` marker is the other (reverting eligibility to `track`
# flips the sponsored/production `--track light` bypass tests RED).

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BL-070: Phase 3 validation scans (Snyk / license / full-tree Semgrep /
# OWASP ZAP DAST / threat-model) + attest-on-skip gate.
#
# The Builder's/User guides imply Phase 3 auto-runs these five scans; a grep
# of scripts/ found ZERO invocations. This distinct, self-contained step
# (Karl-approved Option C) refuses Phase 3→4 unless the aggregate summary
# from scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh exists AND every scanner is PASS or
# an attested-skip-with-signoff (zero un-attested SKIPs, zero FAILs).
#
# Positioned deliberately APART from the review-manifest reviewer check
# (BL-073, further below) to keep the two Phase-3→4 gate edits from
# colliding on rebase.
#
# `# BL-070-GATE-CHECK` marks the load-bearing enforcement (mutation target,
# per tests/test-phase3-validation-gate.sh::T-mutation). Auto-run marked
# `# BL-070-GATE-AUTORUN`. Attestation predicate marked
# `# BL-070-ATTEST-PREDICATE`.
#
# BL-082 (2026-07-09): the summary is bound to the tree it validated. A summary
# is FRESH only if its recorded `tree:` line is present, ≠ `none`, EQUALS the
# current `git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}`, its recorded `dirty:` is `no`, AND the
# live SCOPED working tree is clean (HEAD^{tree} alone misses uncommitted edits
# — a clean-tree summary must not stay trusted while source is edited). Any
# other state → STALE: print `[STALE]`, regenerate offline via the
# `# BL-070-GATE-AUTORUN` path, and evaluate the FRESH summary in a single pass;
# if regeneration is impossible (SOLO_PHASE3_GATE_NOAUTORUN=1 or driver
# missing/non-executable) STALE = gate FAIL (never silently accept a stale
# summary). Pre-BL-082 summaries have no `tree:` line → STALE (backward compat).
# The freshness decision line is marked `# BL-082-STALENESS` (mutation target).
# The scoped dirty check (# BL-082-STALENESS in _cpg_scoped_dirty) EXCLUDES
# `.claude/` and the results dir because the gate itself writes the BL-071 gate
# date into .claude/phase-state.json on PASS (line ~374) and that file is
# TRACKED downstream — an UNSCOPED check would mark every summary permanently
# stale after its first PASS (self-defeating).

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BL-113 — the offline autorun must not launder a real FAIL into a SKIP.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Walk finding F15: whenever the tree is dirty (the NORMAL state while the
# operator is authoring Phase-3 artifacts) the BL-082 staleness check autoruns
# the driver with `--offline`, which SKIPs every tool-backed scanner. The
# operator saw "scanner unavailable", attested the SKIP in good faith, and
# passed — never learning that a REAL semgrep run FAILs (F14). A FAIL is not
# attestable; a SKIP is. The autorun was the laundry.
#
# TWO defences, both marked `# BL-113-NO-LAUNDER`:
#
#   1. IN THE DRIVER (scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh, `_p3_no_launder`): a
#      SKIP never overwrites a prior REAL FAIL — it is promoted back to FAIL
#      with a `[STALE - last real result: FAIL]` note and a machine-readable
#      `CARRIED <scanner> <origin>` line. The gate surfaces that line verbatim
#      below so the operator reads WHY the FAIL is there.
#
#   2. HERE: an offline-autorun SKIP for a scanner whose TOOL IS ON PATH is
#      REFUSED — attested or not. It is not a result; it is the autorun's own
#      choice not to look, and the operator cannot honestly sign "scanner
#      unavailable" for a scanner that is installed. To clear it the operator
#      must run the driver themselves WITHOUT `--offline`, which yields a real
#      verdict (PASS/FAIL) or — with the tool present but no network — an
#      HONEST, attestable SKIP recorded against a non-offline summary.
#
# THE AUTORUN STAYS `--offline` (deliberate, verified): `semgrep --config auto`
# is NOT local-only. It hard-fetches its ruleset from semgrep.dev with no local
# cache fallback (network blackholed: ~97s of retries, rc=2, no report). Running
# it from the gate would make the gate non-hermetic, slow, and would brick
# genuinely-offline operators. The laundering dies; the offline mode does not.
#
# GENUINELY OFFLINE STAYS USABLE: tool absent → no refusal → an honest SKIP is
# still attestable and the gate is still passable. That is the whole point of
# the attest-on-skip design and BL-113 does not touch it.

# _cpg_phase3_scanner_tool <scanner> — echo the single binary whose presence on
# PATH makes the scanner LOCALLY RUNNABLE, or "" when there is no unambiguous
# one. Deliberately narrow (BL-113): only `semgrep-full-tree` is mapped.
#   * semgrep is the SAST the walk caught being laundered, and its real-run path
#     now degrades to an honest attestable SKIP when the rule registry is
#     unreachable (`# BL-113-SEMGREP-OFFLINE`), so forcing a real run can never
#     brick an offline operator.
#   * `snyk`'s real-run path FAILs (not SKIPs) on an offline execution error, so
#     forcing a real snyk run on an offline operator WOULD brick them.
#   * `license` has no single binary (per-language tool); `threat-model` is
#     pure-local and already runs under --offline.
# The DRIVER-side carry-forward (defence 1) protects ALL FIVE scanners, so a
# real FAIL from any of them is still never laundered.

# ── Review-manifest gate (Phase 3+) — BL-073 track-aware enforcement ──
# Historically this block only checked that the manifest FILE existed and
# emitted a WARN when absent — it never verified the six reviewers actually
# ran, so a Full-track project that skipped the Security + Red Team reviews
# passed Phase 3→4 with only a banner. BL-073 makes it a real, track-aware
# gate:
#   • track=full / track=standard  → FAIL if the Security OR Red Team
#     reviewer is missing/not-complete (the mandatory subset per
#     docs/builders-guide.md). Full track additionally requires all six —
#     the other four missing WARN and still count toward gate blocking.
#   • track=light / personal       → WARN only (POC preserved). The bypass
#     is logged to the console/CI audit trail; enforcement flips to FAIL
#     automatically once the track is promoted to standard/full.
# GRANDFATHER: enforcement (the FAIL) applies ONLY to projects created or
#   advanced under the enforcement regime, keyed on phase-state.json::
#   review_gate_enforced (stamped by init.sh at creation, re-stamped by
#   upgrade-project.sh on any tier advance). A pre-existing project that
#   lacks the flag keeps the legacy WARN-only behavior and is NEVER
#   retroactively blocked by the new completeness check.
# ESCAPE HATCH: SOLO_REVIEWERS_ATTESTED=1 + a documented reason (env
#   SOLO_REVIEWERS_ATTESTED_REASON, or a reason already recorded in
#   process-state.json) downgrades the FAIL to an attested OK and RECORDS
#   the decision to .claude/process-state.json::phase3.attestations.reviewers
#   (BL-032 lineage) — blocks are attested, not silenced.

# --- Brownfield adoption: stamp acceptance + loss detection ---
# BF-ADOPT-GATE-BEGIN
# The gate's half of the brownfield enabling arms (design §10-WP3 deliverable
# 4, §12-12). It READS the adoption flag through the single accessor and adds
# no logic to any existing predicate (§9).
#
# THE [WARN] TRAP APPLIES HERE AND THE CHOICE IS DELIBERATE. In this script the
# label is cosmetic — the exit predicate is `if [ $issues -eq 0 ]`, so an
# exemption is the ABSENCE of an increment and a block is its presence. This
# arm INCREMENTS, on purpose: a project whose committed manifest records an
# adoption while the live manifest no longer does has silently un-adopted, and
# a silent un-adoption is precisely the failure §12-12 says cannot be prevented
# and must therefore never be quiet. The upstream regenerating writer lives in
# another repository; the only thing in this design's control is refusing to
# pass the gate while the record is missing. Removing the increment — or the
# detector it calls — turns the failure back into silence.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT FENCED BY `skip_later_gate`. BL-166 confines a `--gate`
# scoped run to the NAMED gate's checks, and that fence is right for checks
# that BELONG to a later gate. This one belongs to no gate: the adoption record
# is a precondition of every arm that reads the flag, so a scoped run that
# passed while the record was missing would be the same silence under a
# narrower heading. Stated here because the omission is a decision, not an
