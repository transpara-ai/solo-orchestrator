# scripts/cut-release.sh — the post-1.0 release cut.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §9.1 (semver, decided by the
# TOOL — the class->bump map is retunable, the PRECEDENCE is machinery, and
# there is NO override in v1), §9.2 (THE THREE REFUSALS AND THEIR ORDER, and
# "performs no write of any kind before all three pass"), §9.3 (promotion, and
# the tag format C7 forces), §8.2 (a major bump re-runs run-phase3-validation.sh
# in full BEFORE the tag is written), §8.3 (overdue and unmeasurable are both
# refusals), §7.1 (`shipped_in` recorded at cut time THROUGH THE SEAM, never by
# touching the file), §3.1 (this file is a DELTA-MODULE file despite its
# core-sounding name), §0.3-C7, §0.3-C8, §11-WP7.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose — no backlog
# entry exists for this build, and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1-WP6
# precedent. The grep-able CUTREL-* markers below are this file's citation
# primitive and its mutation addresses.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE ONE PROPERTY THIS FILE IS ORGANISED AROUND
#
# NO WRITE OF ANY KIND HAPPENS BEFORE ALL THREE REFUSALS PASS (§9.2's last
# line). Not the changelog, not the state record, not the tag, not a scanner
# summary. The reason is stated in the design rather than assumed: "a
# partially-cut release (changelog promoted, tag absent) is a worse state than
# a refused one" — a refusal is a situation you can read and fix, while a
# half-cut release is a repository whose changelog claims a version that no tag
# names and no pipeline ever built.
#
# The whole script is therefore two phases with a hard line between them, and
# the line is marked. PHASE A reads and refuses; it opens no file for writing
# and runs no tool that writes. PHASE B writes, in an order chosen so that the
# most recoverable write happens first. tests/test-delta-wp7-cut-release.sh
# asserts Phase A's emptiness with a whole-tree `find` + per-file md5 manifest
# taken across every refusal path, singly and in combination, PLUS a separate
# count of the repository's tags — because `git tag` writes into `.git/`, which
# a working-tree manifest cannot see.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE THREE REFUSALS, IN §9.2's ORDER, AND WHY THE ORDER IS THAT ONE
#
# The order is author-proposed in the design and chosen so the cheapest and
# clearest refusal speaks first. An operator who has a delta open does not need
# to sit through a maintenance-cadence scan to be told so.
#
#   1. AN OPEN DELTA (`active_delta != null`). Instant, no I/O beyond the state
#      read every refusal needs anyway. "Finish or abandon DELTA-NNN first."
#   2. AN UNFILED HOTFIX RETRO. This is D3's collateral being called in: the
#      hotfix lane ships fast by BORROWING the checks a normal change goes
#      through, `hotfix_retros[]` is the loan, and this refusal is the only
#      thing that ever collects. §7.1 makes the array outlive `active_delta`
#      deliberately for this one moment.
#   3. AN OVERDUE OR UNMEASURABLE CADENCE. The expensive one — it shells out to
#      scripts/check-maintenance.sh, which walks git history and the evidence
#      directory.
#
# TWO CONSUMED CONTRACTS. Neither is re-derived here, and both were written for
# this file by the WPs that shipped them; read their headers before changing a
# line below.
#
#   • scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh — WP5's retro predicates, and the calling
#     shape at the top of that file. THE STRICT READ IS MANDATORY: the tolerant
#     `--delta-state-read` answers a corrupt file with the EMPTY SCHEMA at rc 0
#     and an ABSENT file in complete silence, so with a retro owed, corrupting
#     the record — or `rm`-ing it — would make "is anything owed?" answer "no"
#     and refusal 2 would never fire. `rm` as loan forgiveness in one keystroke.
#     `--delta-state-read-strict` answers rc 0 + document, rc 3 unreadable, rc 4
#     absent, with nothing on stdout in either failure. THIS FILE REFUSES ON
#     BOTH 3 AND 4. On 4: a project that has never opened a delta has nothing to
#     release either (§9.1 refuses "nothing closed since the last tag"), so
#     refusing costs a real project nothing and closes the erasure path.
#   • scripts/check-maintenance.sh — WP6's exit contract: 0 measured-current,
#     1 overdue, 2 unmeasurable. THIS FILE REFUSES ON BOTH 1 AND 2 (§8.3:
#     "overdue and unmeasurable are both refusals"). Its report NAMES every arm
#     it could not measure even inside an rc-1 answer, so the report is
#     surfaced verbatim rather than replaced by a headline of our own.
#
# THE FAIL-CLOSED DIRECTION IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE. Refusal 2 refuses on
# anything that is not a definite "none owed" — an UNDETERMINED ledger refuses
# too. Refusal 3 refuses on any non-zero the checker can produce, not on a
# whitelist of two. An unmapped class refuses rather than defaulting to patch,
# and so does a class nobody could READ. Every one of those is the same
# judgement: under-refusing ships a release over an obligation nobody could
# see, and over-refusing costs an operator one command and a clear message.
#
# REFUSAL 3's `*)` ARM IS NOT DECORATION, AND IT IS THE ONE MOST EASILY
# MISTAKEN FOR IT. `# CUTREL-CADENCE-OTHER` catches every exit code the checker
# is not documented to produce — including 127, which is what `bash` answers
# when the checker HAS BEEN DELETED. Without that arm, `rm
# scripts/check-maintenance.sh` is cadence forgiveness in one keystroke: the
# same `rm`-as-loan-forgiveness class WP5's strict read was built to close, one
# surface over. An adversarial review found the arm unpinned and its weakening
# mutant surviving the whole suite; R11 and m6 exist because of that.
#
# WHERE REFUSAL 2's rc-3 HALF IS REACHABLE FROM, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT
# UNEXPLAINED. Through this script's own flow it is NOT reachable, and the
# argument is a subset one: `_delta_cadence_readable` accepts an object with a
# `hotfix_retros` ARRAY, which is a STRICT SUBSET of what `DELTA_STATE_SHAPE`
# accepts, so any document that survived the strict read above also satisfies
# the predicate. The arm is a backstop for a caller that acquired the document
# some other way — delta-cadence.sh's header makes the same argument about its
# own rc 3 — and A5 pins it AT THE LINE rather than leaving it merely unkilled.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE TAG IS CONSTRAINED, NOT CHOSEN (§9.3 + C7) — DO NOT "IMPROVE" IT
#
# C7 measured the shipped release lanes. GitHub's four templates and
# Bitbucket's four match `v*`. GitLab's four match `/^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/` —
# three numeric components, no pre-release suffix, no two-component tag. So a
# `v1.2.0-rc1` would build on two hosts and SILENTLY DO NOTHING on the third:
# green on the host you tested, nothing at all on the one you did not. That is
# the worst available failure mode, and it is why this emits exactly
# `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and then checks its own output against the regex before
# using it. Pre-release tags are §13-R3's business, not v1's.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SEMVER: THE MAP IS POLICY, THE PRECEDENCE IS MACHINERY (§9.1)
#
# Each closed row not yet shipped contributes ONE token: `breaking` if the row
# carries a breaking marker, otherwise its class. `delta-policy.json::semver`
# maps tokens to bumps and a project may retune it — a `0.x` project can make
# every fix a minor. What a project may NOT do is reorder how the bumps
# COMBINE: major beats minor beats patch, always, because a project that could
# reorder that could make a feature release a patch (§9.1 says so in as many
# words). There is no policy key for it and no flag for it; the rank function
# below is the whole of it.
#
# NO OVERRIDE, AND THE COST IS REAL. An operator who disagrees with the
# computed bump has no flag in v1. §13-R2 records what that costs: a project
# that wants a marketing-driven major has to change the class of what it
# shipped or tag by hand outside this tool. That is the decision; do not soften
# it with a `--version` flag, and do not add one "just for CI".
#
# WHAT "SINCE THE LAST TAG" MEANS OPERATIONALLY. A closed row whose
# `shipped_in` is null has not been carried by any release — that IS the
# question, and it is a stronger reading than a date comparison against the
# last tag, because it survives clock skew, a re-tagged history and a tag
# created by hand. The two coincide in every ordinary case. `shipped_in` is
# write-once at the seam, so a row can never be double-counted.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TWO ADJACENCIES, RECORDED RATHER THAN WIRED
#
#   • `check-phase-gate.sh --finalize-phase 4` (§0.3-C8) is the natural pre-tag
#     check and is invoked by NOTHING today — a second orphan sitting beside
#     the cadence checker this file now calls. Karl did not decide to wire it
#     (design Q3 asks), so it is named here and nowhere else. No executed line
#     in this file references it, and the test suite asserts that.
#   • THE TAG NAMES HEAD, AND HEAD DOES NOT YET CONTAIN THE PROMOTION. This
#     tool deliberately does not COMMIT. Committing would run the project's own
#     pre-commit gate, which can refuse for reasons that have nothing to do
#     with the release and would leave exactly the half-cut state above; and
#     `--no-verify` is never an option in this framework. So the cut ends by
#     telling the operator, in order, to commit what it wrote and to move the
#     (unpushed, therefore free to move) tag onto that commit before pushing.
#     THE COMMIT-VS-NO-COMMIT QUESTION IS KARL'S, AND IT IS OPEN. An
#     adversarial review independently recommended committing then tagging.
#     Until it is decided this flow ships as-is, and the `git tag -f` step is
#     printed as the LOUDEST line on the screen — because an operator who does
#     steps 1, 2 and 4 and skips 3 pushes a tag naming a tree without its own
#     changelog entry, and the pipelines go green over it.
#
# TWO GAPS THAT ARE TRACKED ELSEWHERE, POINTED AT HERE SO THE NEXT READER OF
# THIS FILE FINDS THEM RATHER THAN REDISCOVERING THEM:
#   • THE `breaking` MARKER HAS NO WRITER. §9.1's major row and §8.2's full
#     revalidation lane are fully built and tested but production-unreachable
#     in v1: nothing in delta.sh's close pathway sets the field this file
#     reads. Filed as a tracked item; the writer belongs to the close/confirm
#     surface, not here.
#   • SEVERING THE MODULE TAKES check-maintenance.sh's ONLY BEHAVIOUR COVERAGE
#     WITH IT (tests/test-delta-wp6-cadence.sh is a delta suite that is also a
#     core script's only rc-contract tests). Filed as a tracked item.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES ARE THE ANSWER; THE LABELS ARE DECORATION
#
#   0   the release was cut
#   2   invocation / environment error
#   3   REFUSAL 1 — a delta is open
#   4   REFUSAL 2 — an unfiled hotfix retro (or a ledger nobody can read)
#   5   REFUSAL 3 — cadence overdue or unmeasurable
#   6   REFUSAL — the delta record exists and cannot be read (strict rc 3)
#   7   REFUSAL — there is no delta record at all (strict rc 4)
#   8   REFUSAL — nothing closed since the last tag (§9.1)
#   9   REFUSAL — a closed row's class maps to no bump (fail-closed)
#  10   REFUSAL — major bump, and the §8.2 revalidation did not pass
#  11   a write FAILED after every refusal passed — the cut is incomplete, and
#       the message says exactly how far it got
#  12   THE RELEASE WAS CUT — changelog promoted, shipped_in recorded, tag
#       created — AND one or more ledger rows could not be closed. The release
#       is not failed for it, because it genuinely happened; the cut simply
#       does not report clean, and every row it could not close is named.
#
# CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is that a printed label and an exit predicate can
# disagree — in check-phase-gate.sh two arms printing the same word have
# opposite gate outcomes. Every assertion in the WP7 suite is on one of these
# codes, on a file's bytes, on a whole-tree manifest, or on `git tag --list`.
#
# DEPENDENCY DIRECTION (D1). This file is a DELTA-MODULE file (§3.1) even
# though its name sounds core: it reads `delta-state.json`, and classifying it
# as core would create a second core -> delta edge. delta -> core is allowed and
# unasserted, which is why it may call check-maintenance.sh and
# run-phase3-validation.sh directly. It sources the module's OWN policy and
# cadence libs directly (delta -> delta, the scripts/delta.sh precedent) and
# reaches `delta-state.json` ONLY through the seam.
#
# BASH 3.2: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no `((x++))`, no `nullglob`.

  Cuts the next release. It works out the version number from the work you
  have closed, moves your changelog's Unreleased section under that version,
  records which release carried each closed change, and creates the tag your
  release pipeline watches for.

  It refuses, and does nothing at all, while any of these is true:
    - a delta is still open
    - a hotfix still owes its write-up
    - a maintenance cadence is overdue, or could not be measured

  THERE IS NO WAY TO CHOOSE THE VERSION BY HAND. The tool decides it from the
  classes of what you closed. That is deliberate and it is written down:
  see §9.1 and §13-R2 of docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md."

# ── D-B: THE LEDGER ROWS THIS RELEASE CLOSES (§6.3; Karl, 2026-08-09) ───────
#
# WHY HERE AND NOT AT `--close`. Close is not ship. A closed delta has reached
# nobody, so flipping its row at close would record "this bug is fixed" before
# the fix existed for a single user — a falsehood written into the audit trail,
# which is the exact defect class this wave has been removing. The cut is the
# honest moment, and it is ALREADY looping precisely these rows to write
# `shipped_in`, so it knows which shipped and in which version.
#
# WHAT WAS BROKEN. `delta.sh --open` writes a REAL ledger row for every class
# (WP8, Karl's decision 3): `| SEV-N | Open |` in BUGS.md for fix / hotfix /
# security-patch, `**Status:** In Progress` in FEATURES.md for feature. NOTHING
# EVER FLIPPED EITHER. `--complete-gate ledger_row` records only that the
# operator ATTESTS the row is filled; `--close` writes the state document and
# deliberately nothing else. So every post-1.0 fix left a permanent
# apparently-open SEV-N row, monotonically, in the artefact this framework
# holds up as the bug record. The rows were distinguishable by content — each
# carries its `DELTA-NNN` in Fix Reference — but not by the gate's own
# position-independent grep, and not by a human reading the table.
#
# §6.3 IS A HARD CONSTRAINT AND IT IS OBEYED HERE. BUGS.md's own header says
# "Do NOT change the table format", and scripts/test-gate.sh greps
# `SEV-1.*Open`, `SEV-2.*Open`, `SEV-2.*Deferred` and `SEV-3.*Open` across it.
# So this edits the EXISTING Status cell, and the version goes into the
# EXISTING `Fix Reference` column beside the `DELTA-NNN` already there — the
# column that already takes "PR #12"-shaped values. NEVER a new column. The
# FEATURES block gets the same discipline for the same reason: the version
# rides the existing `**Status:**` line rather than becoming a tenth field.
#
# THE ONLY THING THAT PROMOTES A ROW TO "CLOSED" IS A RE-READ OF THE FILE, and
# that is `# CUTREL-LEDGER-VERIFY` below. WP8 measured the alternative one
# layer down: an unguarded `{ … } >> "$ledger"` returns the FILENAME —
# non-empty — when the write fails, so a caller asking "did it produce output?"
# read a failed write as success, and the resulting lie reached the STATE
# DOCUMENT rather than only the transcript. The writer's own answer is not
# evidence that anything landed. Only the file is.
#
# AND THE WRITE IS A TRUNCATING REDIRECT, NOT A RENAME, so that the most
# ordinary spelling of "this file is protected" is a REACHABLE failure: a
# rename succeeds on a read-only FILE whenever the DIRECTORY is writable, which
# is exactly why WP8's own forced-failure row could only be built against the
# `>>` branch and could not make the mktemp+mv branch fail at all. An unopenable
# target fails before any truncation happens, so a refused write leaves the
# ledger byte-identical rather than empty; the content is staged and checked
# non-empty first, so a failing transform cannot blank the file either.
#
# A FLIP THAT CANNOT BE APPLIED DOES NOT FAIL THE RELEASE. The release
# genuinely happened — the changelog is promoted, the record says shipped, and
# the tag is about to exist — and refusing it now would be a lie in the other
# direction. But it does not report a clean cut either: exit 12, and every row
# it could not close is named, with its own reason.

# THE ID MATCH IS BOUNDED, AND `index()` ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. Every reader below
# goes through an `idhit()` of its own, which asks for a hit whose FOLLOWING
# character is not alphanumeric. A bare substring test makes `DELTA-100` match a
# `DELTA-1000` row — the allocator zero-pads to three and keeps counting, so the
# two coexist the moment a project passes 999 deltas, and the failure is closing
# a bug nobody fixed AND stamping a version onto it that never carried it. A
# REGEX built from the id would be the tidier spelling and is the wrong one: an
# id that ever carried a `.` or a `*` would WIDEN the match rather than narrow
# it, and widening is the direction that closes a row nobody shipped. `substr`
# past the end of a string returns "", which is correctly not alphanumeric, so a
# cell ending in the id still matches.
#
# THE BOUNDARY TEST EXISTS AT THREE SITES AND THEY ARE SYNC SIBLINGS — the state
# reader, the flipper and the FEATURES block chooser, marked
# `# CUTREL-LEDGER-IDBOUND-*`. They are three copies of one rule because they are
# three separate awk programs, and each one is separately lethal:
#   * lose it in the STATE reader and a shipped row that really did close is
#     re-read as open, so the cut reports a failure it did not have;
#   * lose it in the FLIPPER and a row this release never touched is stamped
#     `shipped in vX.Y.Z` — a false close, at rc 0, reported as a clean cut;
#   * lose it in the BLOCK chooser and the wrong feature is completed.
# tests/test-delta-db-ledger-close.sh drives m8/m9/m10 at the three of them
# INDEPENDENTLY for that reason; stripping all three at once was measured to
# survive an earlier version of that suite.
#
# AND THE SEARCH DOES NOT STOP AT THE FIRST HIT. `Fix Reference` is free text
# that legitimately carries more than one id, so `DELTA-1000, DELTA-100` shipping
# `DELTA-100` would hit the prefix first, fail the boundary test, and — with a
# single `index()` — report "no row naming it" over a row that names it plainly.
# The loop retries past every rejected hit, so a rejection narrows the match
# without ever losing a real one.

# _cutrel_bugs_state <file> <id> — `<state> 0`, state being none | open | fixed.
#   The trailing `0` is the FEATURES block index, which BUGS.md does not have —
#   the two readers answer in one shape so the loop below has ONE read to guard
#   rather than two spellings of it.
#   THE ROW IS IDENTIFIED STRUCTURALLY, not by a bare grep for the id: it must
#   be a table line of exactly the nine shipped columns (ten `|`-delimited
#   fields plus the empty one each side => NF 11) whose FIX REFERENCE cell
#   names the delta. That is where §6.3 puts the link, so that is where it is
#   looked for — and it is what keeps the Status Guide and Severity Guide
#   tables further down the same file out of reach.

# THE BUGS TABLE HAS A COLUMN FOR THE LINK AND FEATURES.md DOES NOT, so the two

# `Fix Reference` — which is why the readers above can demand a nine-column row
# and read field 9, and why free text elsewhere in BUGS.md cannot reach them. A
# `## Feature` block is prose with a few bolded labels. Accepting the id
# ANYWHERE inside one accepts it in a Summary: a feature whose description said
# "superseded by DELTA-007" would be stamped `**Status:** Complete (shipped in
# vX.Y.Z)`, and the run would print `[OK] Closed 1` and exit 0. That is a FALSE
# CLOSE REPORTED AS A CLEAN CUT — the defect class this whole change removes one
# level up, reintroduced one level down by the fix for it. So the id is matched
# on the writer's own structural line and nowhere else.
#
# WHAT `delta.sh::_ledger_write` EMITS for the feature class, which is where the

#     **Phase Built:** 4 (post-1.0 <id>)
#     **Status:** In Progress
#     **Summary:** <describe>
#     …
#
# The id lands on `**Phase Built:**` — and on `**Brief:**` too when a brief path
# happens to carry it, which is exactly why the anchor is the line the writer
# emits UNCONDITIONALLY for every feature it opens. SYNC SIBLING: change that
# line in `_ledger_write` and this anchor has to move with it, or every feature
# opened afterwards will read as "no row naming it" at its cut.
#
# A BLOCK WITHOUT THAT LINE IS NOT A BLOCK THIS FRAMEWORK WROTE, and the cut
# says so — "FEATURES.md has no row naming it", rc 12, close it by hand — rather
# than guessing. That is the safe direction: the alternative is stamping a
# shipped version onto somebody else's feature and reporting it as done.

# _cutrel_features_block <file> <id> — the 1-based index of the `## Feature`
#   block WHOSE OWN `**Phase Built:**` LINE NAMES THE DELTA, or 0.

#   THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT DECIDES WHICH BLOCK BELONGS TO A DELTA. The

#   THIS IS THE GUARD, AND IT HAD TO BE A PROBE RATHER THAN AN EXIT STATUS. The

#   `rstate="$(_cutrel_bugs_state …)" || rstate=unreadable`. It was measured on
#   bash 3.2 and it is WRONG BY LEDGER: `set -e` is suspended for everything
#   underneath a command that is itself guarded, so inside a guarded call the
#   FEATURES reader's own `blk="$(_cutrel_features_block …)"` no longer aborts —
#   it returns empty, normalises to block 0, and the function answers `none`,
#   successfully. The same guard over the same unreadable file therefore says
#   `unreadable` for BUGS.md and `none` for FEATURES.md, and `none` is the one
#   answer this must never give: "has no row naming it" about a row that may
#   well be sitting there, on a file nobody could look at.
#
#   `[ -r ]` was not enough either — it reads the permission bits and answers a
#   question about the file, where the question that matters is whether THIS
#   process can open it. So the probe opens it, which is exactly what awk is
#   about to do, and the subshell keeps the failed redirection's message off the

#   did not happen" and "the project's bug record is now a zero byte file". The
#   write is a TRUNCATING REDIRECT: it opens the target and empties it before a
#   byte is copied in, so empty staged content does not fail, it DESTROYS. The
#   temp file exists from the moment `mktemp` returns, which is why existence is
#   not the question — content is. A transform that died halfway produces

#   thing standing between it and the ledger.
