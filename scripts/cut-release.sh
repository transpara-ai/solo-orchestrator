# scripts/cut-release.sh — the post-1.0 release cut.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §9.1 (semver, decided by the
# TOOL — the class->bump map is retunable, the PRECEDENCE is machinery, and
# there is NO override in v1), §9.2 (THE THREE REFUSALS AND THEIR ORDER, and
# "performs no write of any kind before all three pass"), §9.3 (promotion, and
# the tag format C7 forces), §8.2 (a major bump re-runs run-phase3-validation.sh
# in full BEFORE the tag is written), §8.3 (overdue and unmeasurable are both
# refusals), §7.1 (`shipped_in` recorded at cut time THROUGH THE SEAM, never by
# touching the file), §3.1 (this file is a DELTA-MODULE file despite its
# core-sounding name), §0.3-C7, §0.3-C8, §11-WP7.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose — no backlog
# entry exists for this build, and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1-WP6
# precedent. The grep-able CUTREL-* markers below are this file's citation
# primitive and its mutation addresses.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE ONE PROPERTY THIS FILE IS ORGANISED AROUND
#
# NO WRITE OF ANY KIND HAPPENS BEFORE ALL THREE REFUSALS PASS (§9.2's last
# line). Not the changelog, not the state record, not the tag, not a scanner
# summary. The reason is stated in the design rather than assumed: "a
# partially-cut release (changelog promoted, tag absent) is a worse state than
# a refused one" — a refusal is a situation you can read and fix, while a
# half-cut release is a repository whose changelog claims a version that no tag
# names and no pipeline ever built.
#
# The whole script is therefore two phases with a hard line between them, and
# the line is marked. PHASE A reads and refuses; it opens no file for writing
# and runs no tool that writes. PHASE B writes, in an order chosen so that the
# most recoverable write happens first. tests/test-delta-wp7-cut-release.sh
# asserts Phase A's emptiness with a whole-tree `find` + per-file md5 manifest
# taken across every refusal path, singly and in combination, PLUS a separate
# count of the repository's tags — because `git tag` writes into `.git/`, which
# a working-tree manifest cannot see.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE THREE REFUSALS, IN §9.2's ORDER, AND WHY THE ORDER IS THAT ONE
#
# The order is author-proposed in the design and chosen so the cheapest and
# clearest refusal speaks first. An operator who has a delta open does not need
# to sit through a maintenance-cadence scan to be told so.
#
#   1. AN OPEN DELTA (`active_delta != null`). Instant, no I/O beyond the state
#      read every refusal needs anyway. "Finish or abandon DELTA-NNN first."
#   2. AN UNFILED HOTFIX RETRO. This is D3's collateral being called in: the
#      hotfix lane ships fast by BORROWING the checks a normal change goes
#      through, `hotfix_retros[]` is the loan, and this refusal is the only
#      thing that ever collects. §7.1 makes the array outlive `active_delta`
#      deliberately for this one moment.
#   3. AN OVERDUE OR UNMEASURABLE CADENCE. The expensive one — it shells out to
#      scripts/check-maintenance.sh, which walks git history and the evidence
#      directory.
#
# TWO CONSUMED CONTRACTS. Neither is re-derived here, and both were written for
# this file by the WPs that shipped them; read their headers before changing a
# line below.
#
#   • scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh — WP5's retro predicates, and the calling
#     shape at the top of that file. THE STRICT READ IS MANDATORY: the tolerant
#     `--delta-state-read` answers a corrupt file with the EMPTY SCHEMA at rc 0
#     and an ABSENT file in complete silence, so with a retro owed, corrupting
#     the record — or `rm`-ing it — would make "is anything owed?" answer "no"
#     and refusal 2 would never fire. `rm` as loan forgiveness in one keystroke.
#     `--delta-state-read-strict` answers rc 0 + document, rc 3 unreadable, rc 4
#     absent, with nothing on stdout in either failure. THIS FILE REFUSES ON
#     BOTH 3 AND 4. On 4: a project that has never opened a delta has nothing to
#     release either (§9.1 refuses "nothing closed since the last tag"), so
#     refusing costs a real project nothing and closes the erasure path.
#   • scripts/check-maintenance.sh — WP6's exit contract: 0 measured-current,
#     1 overdue, 2 unmeasurable. THIS FILE REFUSES ON BOTH 1 AND 2 (§8.3:
#     "overdue and unmeasurable are both refusals"). Its report NAMES every arm
#     it could not measure even inside an rc-1 answer, so the report is
#     surfaced verbatim rather than replaced by a headline of our own.
#
# THE FAIL-CLOSED DIRECTION IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE. Refusal 2 refuses on
# anything that is not a definite "none owed" — an UNDETERMINED ledger refuses
# too. Refusal 3 refuses on any non-zero the checker can produce, not on a
# whitelist of two. An unmapped class refuses rather than defaulting to patch,
# and so does a class nobody could READ. Every one of those is the same
# judgement: under-refusing ships a release over an obligation nobody could
# see, and over-refusing costs an operator one command and a clear message.
#
# REFUSAL 3's `*)` ARM IS NOT DECORATION, AND IT IS THE ONE MOST EASILY
# MISTAKEN FOR IT. `# CUTREL-CADENCE-OTHER` catches every exit code the checker
# is not documented to produce — including 127, which is what `bash` answers
# when the checker HAS BEEN DELETED. Without that arm, `rm
# scripts/check-maintenance.sh` is cadence forgiveness in one keystroke: the
# same `rm`-as-loan-forgiveness class WP5's strict read was built to close, one
# surface over. An adversarial review found the arm unpinned and its weakening
# mutant surviving the whole suite; R11 and m6 exist because of that.
#
# WHERE REFUSAL 2's rc-3 HALF IS REACHABLE FROM, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT
# UNEXPLAINED. Through this script's own flow it is NOT reachable, and the
# argument is a subset one: `_delta_cadence_readable` accepts an object with a
# `hotfix_retros` ARRAY, which is a STRICT SUBSET of what `DELTA_STATE_SHAPE`
# accepts, so any document that survived the strict read above also satisfies
# the predicate. The arm is a backstop for a caller that acquired the document
# some other way — delta-cadence.sh's header makes the same argument about its
# own rc 3 — and A5 pins it AT THE LINE rather than leaving it merely unkilled.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE TAG IS CONSTRAINED, NOT CHOSEN (§9.3 + C7) — DO NOT "IMPROVE" IT
#
# C7 measured the shipped release lanes. GitHub's four templates and
# Bitbucket's four match `v*`. GitLab's four match `/^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/` —
# three numeric components, no pre-release suffix, no two-component tag. So a
# `v1.2.0-rc1` would build on two hosts and SILENTLY DO NOTHING on the third:
# green on the host you tested, nothing at all on the one you did not. That is
# the worst available failure mode, and it is why this emits exactly
# `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and then checks its own output against the regex before
# using it. Pre-release tags are §13-R3's business, not v1's.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SEMVER: THE MAP IS POLICY, THE PRECEDENCE IS MACHINERY (§9.1)
#
# Each closed row not yet shipped contributes ONE token: `breaking` if the row
# carries a breaking marker, otherwise its class. `delta-policy.json::semver`
# maps tokens to bumps and a project may retune it — a `0.x` project can make
# every fix a minor. What a project may NOT do is reorder how the bumps
# COMBINE: major beats minor beats patch, always, because a project that could
# reorder that could make a feature release a patch (§9.1 says so in as many
# words). There is no policy key for it and no flag for it; the rank function
# below is the whole of it.
#
# NO OVERRIDE, AND THE COST IS REAL. An operator who disagrees with the
# computed bump has no flag in v1. §13-R2 records what that costs: a project
# that wants a marketing-driven major has to change the class of what it
# shipped or tag by hand outside this tool. That is the decision; do not soften
# it with a `--version` flag, and do not add one "just for CI".
#
# WHAT "SINCE THE LAST TAG" MEANS OPERATIONALLY. A closed row whose
# `shipped_in` is null has not been carried by any release — that IS the
# question, and it is a stronger reading than a date comparison against the
# last tag, because it survives clock skew, a re-tagged history and a tag
# created by hand. The two coincide in every ordinary case. `shipped_in` is
# write-once at the seam, so a row can never be double-counted.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TWO ADJACENCIES, RECORDED RATHER THAN WIRED
#
#   • `check-phase-gate.sh --finalize-phase 4` (§0.3-C8) is the natural pre-tag
#     check and is invoked by NOTHING today — a second orphan sitting beside
#     the cadence checker this file now calls. Karl did not decide to wire it
#     (design Q3 asks), so it is named here and nowhere else. No executed line
#     in this file references it, and the test suite asserts that.
#   • THE TAG NAMES HEAD, AND HEAD DOES NOT YET CONTAIN THE PROMOTION. This
#     tool deliberately does not COMMIT. Committing would run the project's own
#     pre-commit gate, which can refuse for reasons that have nothing to do
#     with the release and would leave exactly the half-cut state above; and
#     `--no-verify` is never an option in this framework. So the cut ends by
#     telling the operator, in order, to commit what it wrote and to move the
#     (unpushed, therefore free to move) tag onto that commit before pushing.
#     THE COMMIT-VS-NO-COMMIT QUESTION IS KARL'S, AND IT IS OPEN. An
#     adversarial review independently recommended committing then tagging.
#     Until it is decided this flow ships as-is, and the `git tag -f` step is
#     printed as the LOUDEST line on the screen — because an operator who does
#     steps 1, 2 and 4 and skips 3 pushes a tag naming a tree without its own
#     changelog entry, and the pipelines go green over it.
#
# TWO GAPS THAT ARE TRACKED ELSEWHERE, POINTED AT HERE SO THE NEXT READER OF
# THIS FILE FINDS THEM RATHER THAN REDISCOVERING THEM:
#   • THE `breaking` MARKER HAS NO WRITER. §9.1's major row and §8.2's full
#     revalidation lane are fully built and tested but production-unreachable
#     in v1: nothing in delta.sh's close pathway sets the field this file
#     reads. Filed as a tracked item; the writer belongs to the close/confirm
#     surface, not here.
#   • SEVERING THE MODULE TAKES check-maintenance.sh's ONLY BEHAVIOUR COVERAGE
#     WITH IT (tests/test-delta-wp6-cadence.sh is a delta suite that is also a
#     core script's only rc-contract tests). Filed as a tracked item.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES ARE THE ANSWER; THE LABELS ARE DECORATION
#
#   0   the release was cut
#   2   invocation / environment error
#   3   REFUSAL 1 — a delta is open
#   4   REFUSAL 2 — an unfiled hotfix retro (or a ledger nobody can read)
#   5   REFUSAL 3 — cadence overdue or unmeasurable
#   6   REFUSAL — the delta record exists and cannot be read (strict rc 3)
#   7   REFUSAL — there is no delta record at all (strict rc 4)
#   8   REFUSAL — nothing closed since the last tag (§9.1)
#   9   REFUSAL — a closed row's class maps to no bump (fail-closed)
#  10   REFUSAL — major bump, and the §8.2 revalidation did not pass
#  11   a write FAILED after every refusal passed — the cut is incomplete, and
#       the message says exactly how far it got
#
# CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is that a printed label and an exit predicate can
# disagree — in check-phase-gate.sh two arms printing the same word have
# opposite gate outcomes. Every assertion in the WP7 suite is on one of these
# codes, on a file's bytes, on a whole-tree manifest, or on `git tag --list`.
#
# DEPENDENCY DIRECTION (D1). This file is a DELTA-MODULE file (§3.1) even
# though its name sounds core: it reads `delta-state.json`, and classifying it
# as core would create a second core -> delta edge. delta -> core is allowed and
# unasserted, which is why it may call check-maintenance.sh and
# run-phase3-validation.sh directly. It sources the module's OWN policy and
# cadence libs directly (delta -> delta, the scripts/delta.sh precedent) and
# reaches `delta-state.json` ONLY through the seam.

# BASH 3.2: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no `((x++))`, no `nullglob`.

  Cuts the next release. It works out the version number from the work you
  have closed, moves your changelog's Unreleased section under that version,
  records which release carried each closed change, and creates the tag your
  release pipeline watches for.

  It refuses, and does nothing at all, while any of these is true:
    - a delta is still open
    - a hotfix still owes its write-up
    - a maintenance cadence is overdue, or could not be measured

  THERE IS NO WAY TO CHOOSE THE VERSION BY HAND. The tool decides it from the
  classes of what you closed. That is deliberate and it is written down:
  see §9.1 and §13-R2 of docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md."
