# ── DELTA-SEAM-BEGIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE ONE SEAM into the post-MVP delta module.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §3.1 (the module inventory and
# "the one seam"), §7.1 (the state schema and D7's single-writer rule), §7.2
# (the project-owned policy schema), §3.2 (NOTICE-ONLY), §0.3-C9/C10.
#
# WHY THIS FILE AND NO OTHER (C10). `pre-commit-gate.sh` already invokes this
# script (`# BL-010-COMMITMSG-BL006` and the `--check-commit-ready --subject`
# call), so it is BOTH the commit-gate classifier and D7's designated single
# writer of `.claude/delta-state.json`. "One narrow seam into the commit gate"
# (D1) and "single writer = process-checklist.sh" (D7) therefore name ONE
# core -> delta edge, not two. scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh allowlists exactly
# this path and ASSERTS the allowlist length is 1 — a second seam is a design
# change, not an append.
#
# D7, THE SINGLE-WRITER RULE, AND WHAT IT COSTS. Nothing else writes
# `.claude/delta-state.json` — not `delta.sh`, not `cut-release.sh`, not the
# session hook. They all ROUTE their writes through `--delta-state-update`.
# §0.3-C9 records that this is a NEW, stricter invariant than the framework's
# own practice (`.claude/process-state.json` has four writers today), so it is
# not inherited and cannot be assumed: the lint is what makes it checkable.
#
# THE SURFACE, AND WHY IT IS THIS SMALL
#   --delta-state-read              print the state document (§7.1), or the
#                                   empty schema when there is none. rc 0.
#                                   TOLERANT ON PURPOSE — a corrupt file warns
#                                   on stderr and reads as empty, so one bad
#                                   edit cannot kill the whole toolchain. That
#                                   is right for every PER-DELTA operation and
#                                   WRONG for exactly one question; see below.
#   --delta-state-read-strict       the same document, but NEVER falling back:
#                                   rc 0 with the document; rc 3 when the file
#                                   exists and cannot be read as a state
#                                   document; rc 4 when there is no file at all.
#                                   Nothing on stdout in either failure case.
#                                   FOR RELEASE-GATING READS (R-WP5-2). An
#                                   adversarial review showed that with a hotfix
#                                   retro owed, corrupting the state file makes
#                                   the tolerant read answer with the empty
#                                   schema at rc 0 and DELETING it is silent —
#                                   so §9.2's "any open retro blocks the cut"
#                                   never fires and `rm` is loan forgiveness in
#                                   one keystroke. Illegibility of a due DATE is
#                                   treated as overdue (WP5); illegibility of
#                                   the LEDGER must not be treated as absolution.
#   --delta-state-update <jq>       read -> apply the filter -> ATOMIC write
#                                   under the APPEND rule. ONE guarded primitive
#                                   rather than a verb per caller (activation /
#                                   gates_completed append / retro append /
#                                   cadence stamp / closed append): five verbs
#                                   would be five places to forget the guard,
#                                   and the guard — not the verb — is what D7 is
#                                   actually about.
#                                   WHAT THE GUARD ACTUALLY REFUSES, precisely,
#                                   because "anything that violates the schema"
#                                   was an over-claim: a candidate that is not an
#                                   object with exactly the five §7.1 keys;
#                                   schemaVersion that is not a number;
#                                   active_delta that is neither object nor null;
#                                   hotfix_retros / closed that are not arrays;
#                                   cadence that is not an object; a closed row
#                                   that is not an object; and any drop, reorder
#                                   or rewrite of an existing closed row. WP4
#                                   added one more: a candidate that swaps a
#                                   DIFFERENT delta id into an already-occupied
#                                   active_delta slot, which would discard the
#                                   open delta's gates_completed history. The
#                                   operator-facing refusal stays in delta.sh
#                                   where it can name the delta in the way; this
#                                   one closes the crafted-filter path into the
#                                   same loss.
#                                   WHAT IT DOES NOT REFUSE, deliberately:
#                                   MUTATING an open active_delta in place — a
#                                   gates_completed append, a close-time
#                                   attribute raise. Every legitimate write has
#                                   that shape, so only the id swap is refused.
#                                   Inner shapes of cadence / hotfix_retros /
#                                   active_delta are likewise later WPs' — see
#                                   the WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ENFORCE
#                                   block in scripts/lib/delta-state.sh.
#   --delta-state-ship <id> <ver>   record `shipped_in` on an already-closed
#                                   delta — §7.1's cut-time write, which
#                                   `cut-release.sh` (§9) reaches through here
#                                   and never by touching the file. A SEPARATE,
#                                   narrower pathway on purpose: the append rule
#                                   is not widened by one character, and this
#                                   action permits EXACTLY ONE mutation shape —
#                                   one closed row's shipped_in going null -> a
#                                   non-empty string, everything else identical.
#                                   WRITE-ONCE: a row that already has a version
#                                   is refused, never overwritten.
#   --delta-policy-init             seed `.claude/delta-policy.json` with the
#                                   §7.2 defaults, ONCE. Never overwrites.
#   --delta-policy-get <key>        dotted-key read with per-key fallback to the
#                                   framework defaults. rc 1 if the key exists
#                                   nowhere.
#   --delta-policy-notice           the §3.2 NOTICE-ONLY key-diff. Prints one
#                                   line naming policy keys the framework has
#                                   learned that the project file lacks, and
#                                   writes nothing. Silent when there is no
#                                   policy file or nothing is missing.
#
# WHY THE BLOCK IS HERE AND CONTIGUOUS. Every reference to the delta module in
# this file lives between these two markers — including the flag matching — so
# §3.1's severability test (WP7: delete the module, revert the seam, the full
# suite still passes) is a single-block revert. That is also why the delta
# actions are NOT listed in `--help` below: the help text would be a second,
# non-contiguous delta reference in a core file.
#
# It sits AFTER `guard_not_in_framework` on purpose — the seam writes into
# `.claude/`, so it must refuse to run inside the framework repo exactly like
# every other action here. Tests therefore run in fixtures, never in-tree.
#
# The dispatch runs BEFORE the main argument loop so a delta action never
# touches `.claude/process-state.json` (`ensure_state_file`) as a side effect.

# counts as an identity when it says WHICH feature — these say only that the

# WALK-ISSUE-010-IDENTITY: does this commit subject NAME the given feature?
# The identity bound is what keeps the UAT-2026-04-25 C2 grace window shut
# while still letting a CLOSED loop authorize its own feature's commit
# (see # WALK-ISSUE-010-CLOSED-LOOP-BEGIN).
#   - The haystack is the SCOPE plus the DESCRIPTION, never the `feat` type
#     token itself (otherwise every feat: subject would "name" any feature
#     whose slug contains the word "feat" — e.g. UAT's own `uat-feat-1`).
#   - MATCH 1: the whole feature slug as a contiguous TOKEN SEQUENCE. Token
#     bounded at EVERY length. The first cut used a raw substring for slugs of
#     four characters or more and the 2026-08-02 adversarial review walked
#     straight through it in both directions: `auth2` and `authentication`
#     both "named" the feature `auth`, and `performance` "named" `form`.
#     Letters inside a word are not a name.
#   - MATCH 2: ONE shared whole token, if that token is DISTINCTIVE — at
#     least five characters AND not in the stoplist above. The same review
#     blessed unrelated subjects through `with` and `user`; a generic
#     engineering noun (`service`, `config`, `update`) is that defect one size
#     up. Five is a pinned WIDTH, asserted from both sides by U32 in
#     tests/test-check-commit-message.sh, because a reviewer mutant that
#     loosened the old threshold by one character survived the whole suite.
#   - REMAINING GENEROSITY, stated rather than hidden: two features that share
#     one distinctive word ("export-pdf" / "export-csv") can still name each
#     other. That is the price of not demanding the slug verbatim, and it is
#     bounded by the second half of the binding — the closed loop's own files
#     must also be staged (# WALK-ISSUE-010-PATHBIND).
# Returns 0 on a match, 1 otherwise (including an empty subject — a caller
# that cannot supply the subject gets no closed-loop credit, fail closed).

    #   paths fall back to identity alone, because there is nothing to bind
    #   against. Naming them is the honest alternative to pretending the bind
    #   is total.
    #   A THIRD BOUND WAS CONSIDERED AND DECLINED (R-GATEUX-6): the receipt
    #   already carries `completed_at`, so a freshness window is one comparison
    #   away. It is not here because expiring a receipt re-creates exactly the
    #   dead end this fix exists to remove — a Friday loop, a Monday commit,
    #   blocked — and because ISO-8601-to-epoch parsing is the GNU/BSD `date`
    #   split this repo has been bitten by before. Recorded as a residual, not

    #   satisfy the path half later. It is a floor under the identity bound,
    #   not an identity of its own.
    #   THE WIDEST REMAINING OVERLAP, named rather than left to be found:
    #   FEATURES.md and CHANGELOG.md are dirty at nearly every loop close
    #   (`test-gate.sh --record-feature` writes them just before step 6), so
    #   they sit in most receipts and EVERY feature touches them. They are
    #   deliberately NOT filtered — they are the documentation_updated step's
    #   real output, and dropping them would block the honest docs-follow-up
    #   commit — but that means a subject naming a stale feature while staging
    #   FEATURES.md clears the path half on shared bookkeeping. The identity
    #   half is what refuses it. Unlike `.claude/`, these are the operator's
    #   own work product, which is why the line is drawn here.
    #   `.claude/` IS EXCLUDED, and that exclusion is load-bearing (R-GATEUX-1,
    #   2026-08-02 adversarial review). Generated projects TRACK
    #   .claude/process-state.json and CLOSING THE LOOP WRITES IT — so it was
    #   dirty at capture time and landed in every receipt. A naive `git add -A`
    #   then staged it, which satisfied the path binding by itself: the
    #   reviewer committed an unrelated file under a stale feature name, rc=0.
    #   Framework bookkeeping is never evidence of a feature's work. Pinned by
    #   U29; without the filter the receipt is also never empty, which made the
    #   documented empty-paths fallback dead code in real projects.
    # An empty result stays legitimate (a loop closed on a clean tree — the
    # commit-FIRST ordering) and falls back to identity alone rather than
