# ── BL-176: git-dir-aware path resolution ────────────────────────────
# In a LINKED GIT WORKTREE `.git` is a FILE (a `gitdir:` pointer), not a
# directory, and the per-worktree state git writes around commit time —
# MERGE_HEAD / CHERRY_PICK_HEAD / REVERT_HEAD / COMMIT_EDITMSG — lives in
# `<main-checkout>/.git/worktrees/<name>/`. Every literal `.git/<NAME>` path in
# this file was therefore BLIND inside a worktree, with two OPPOSITE failure
# directions: the sentinel skips silently stopped firing (over-strict: a resumed
# merge/cherry-pick/revert was spuriously refused) while the COMMIT_EDITMSG read
# silently returned the EMPTY STRING, which made BOTH message-scoped commit-msg
# gates no-op entirely (a real gate loss). `git rev-parse --git-path <name>` is
# the correct resolution: it has existed since git 2.5 (2015) and returns
# `.git/<name>` VERBATIM in a normal checkout, so it is a drop-in there. The
# literal fallback keeps a git too old (or too broken) to answer behaving
# exactly as this script did before.

# appears in the command string for the PreToolUse command-string filters to
# catch, and at commit-msg time there is no command string at all.

# ── BL-072 Phase C2: tier-keyed TDD-ordering hard block ──────────────
# C1 (PR #163) shipped the detector in WARN-only measurement mode. C2 makes it
# a real gate whose severity is keyed on the project TIER:
#   • BYPASSABLE tier (Personal / Private-POC): WARN only; the bypass is LOGGED
#     to .claude/tdd-warn-ledger.jsonl (that log IS the audit trail).
#   • NON-bypassable tier (Sponsored-POC / Production): HARD BLOCK, unless the
#     operator attests the exception (SOLO_TDD_ATTESTED=1) — which is RECORDED
#     to .claude/process-state.json::tdd_attestations[] (attested, not silenced
#     — BL-032/071 lineage).
# The hard block is emitted on the git COMMIT-MSG hook surface, reached via
# `pre-commit-gate.sh --terminal-mode --tdd-only` (a non-zero exit aborts the
# commit). commit-msg is the only git-hook point where .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG holds
# the CURRENT commit message — a pre-commit hook sees a STALE message (git
# writes it after pre-commit), which is why the message-scoped gate cannot live
# there. The PreToolUse path keeps its C1 WARN detector as a pre-execution
# measurement heads-up (it reads the subject from the Bash command, not the
# hook file); the commit-msg hook is the enforcement point for both agent and
# human commits. These helpers are defined up here so the --terminal-mode block
# below (which runs and exits before the PreToolUse body) can call them.

# _bl072_tier_bypassable
# BL-084-TIER-KEY. SYNC SIBLINGS — keep these three semantically identical:
#   init.sh::_bl084_tier_bypassable  ·  scripts/check-phase-gate.sh Phase 1->2

#   (deployment + poc_mode from .claude/phase-state.json), NEVER `track`:
#   BL-084 proved `track` is spoofable (--track light on a sponsored/production
#   project). This reads the file directly (the siblings read shell/local vars
#   they already hold); the SEMANTICS — not the read mechanism — must match.
#
# MOTHERSHIP SAFETY (hard requirement): a missing .claude/phase-state.json OR a
# missing/empty deployment key => BYPASSABLE (WARN-only). solo-orchestrator
# itself runs this hook on every commit and is NOT a framework-scaffolded

  # ── Brownfield adoption: the PRE-ADOPTION exemption ────────────────
  # BF-ADOPT-TDD-BEGIN
  # Design §5.3 classifies TDD ordering as kind (c) — INHERENTLY HISTORICAL.
  # The ordering of an adoptee's 2023 commits is not a re-runnable fact, so
  # nothing is measured for it; what is recorded instead is a dated exemption
  # SCOPED to commits at or before the adoption commit. That scope is the whole
  # design: soif_adoption_pre_adoption_commit owns the bound, and an unbounded
  # version of this arm would be a permanent TDD waiver wearing an adoption
  # badge (§4.5: no arm anywhere exempts a commit written after adoption day).
  #
  # THIS IS ONE ARM AND IT CHANGES NOTHING ELSE (§9). The trigger predicate
  # (_tdd_triggers), the tier behaviour (_bl072_tier_bypassable and both
  # emitters) and the ledger rows are untouched — this arm deliberately writes
  # NO ledger row, because the row vocabulary is part of what §9 keeps fixed.
  # It is placed AFTER the trigger so it only ever speaks when the gate would
  # otherwise fire, and BEFORE the tier split because the exemption is a fact
  # about history, not a severity.
  #
  # HONEST LIMIT, stated rather than implied: kind (c)'s forward equivalent is
  # the test-debt ledger and its ratchet (§5.4). It is NAMED here and it is NOT
  # IMPLEMENTED — WP5b owns it. Until it lands, this exemption's forward
  # counterpart does not exist, and the arm claims only what it does: it
  # exempts pre-adoption commits and nothing else.
  #
  # The decision is computed FIRST and the guard is a single line, so the
  # dual-direction mutation proof can neuter exactly one line without splicing
  # a multi-line `if` condition into nonsense — a "one-line" edit that lands
  # mid-continuation changes the parse, not the semantics, and a proof built on
  # it measures the wrong thing. `A && B && var=1` is set -e safe (the AND-OR
  # list exemption), and it is the shape the BL-072 `_fire=1` line above uses.

Usage: pre-commit-gate.sh [--terminal-mode] [--tdd-only | --commit-msg-gates]

Surfaces:
  (no flags)          PreToolUse hook mode: reads tool-input JSON on stdin,
                      emits JSON verdicts on stdout. Not for manual use.
  --terminal-mode     Git-hook/terminal mode: reads staged files from
                      `git diff --cached`, prints diagnostics to stderr.
                      Runs the message-INDEPENDENT pre-commit gates plus the
                      process checklist and operator-side lints. Runs NO
                      message-scoped gate (BL-119: a pre-commit hook sees a
                      STALE .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG).
  --tdd-only          With --terminal-mode: run ONLY the two MESSAGE-SCOPED
                      commit-msg gates — the BL-072 tier-keyed TDD-ordering
                      gate AND the BL-006 Build-Loop commit-message check
                      (BL-010). Despite the name it is NOT TDD-only; the name
                      is retained for back-compat with commit-msg hooks
                      already installed by init.sh (BL-096).
  --commit-msg-gates  Honest-name alias for --tdd-only (BL-096). Identical
                      behavior; new hooks and humans should prefer this name.
  --emit-blocked-gate With --tdd-only: on a block, exit with a gate-specific
                      code (3 = BL-072 TDD ordering, 4 = BL-006 Build Loop) so
                      the emitted commit-msg hook can record which gate refused
                      in the bypass-audit ledger (BL-171). Off by default; all
                      other callers see the plain "block == exit 1" contract.

Exit codes: 0 = allow the commit, non-zero = block (the diagnostic names the
gate that refused). With --emit-blocked-gate the block code is 3 (TDD) / 4
(Build Loop); without it, every block is exit 1.

# --- BL-072 Phase C1: TDD-ordering detector (WARN mode, measurement) ---
# Fires on feat/fix/refactor commits that add/modify implementation files
# with NO test file in the same commit AND no test file earlier on the branch
# (git diff main...HEAD). On trigger it prints a [WARN] would-block
# explanation to stderr and appends a JSON row to
# .claude/tdd-warn-ledger.jsonl. It is measurement-only: it NEVER denies and
# NEVER changes the exit code (the hook still exits 0). Phase C2 (the hard
# block) is deliberately NOT implemented here — it ships only after Karl
# reviews the measured false-block rate from the dogfood replay.
#
# The file-classification core (_bl072_classify_paths) lives in
# scripts/lib/tdd-classify.sh and is shared verbatim with the replay tool.
# Known C1 limitation: classification is path-based only, so a feat/fix/
# refactor commit that changes ONLY comments in an implementation file still
# counts as implementation and will WARN. WARN-only makes that safe; the
# dogfood surfaces it as a false positive.

# Extract the first line (subject) of the prospective commit message from the
# Bash command. Self-contained so the detector can run early, before the
# BL-006 block, and fire even for commits a later gate would deny.
