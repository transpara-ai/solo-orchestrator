# scripts/install-contributor-hooks.sh — BL-096 (ergonomics F10): the
# contributor hook bootstrap as ONE command instead of a copy-pasted recipe.
#
#   bash scripts/install-contributor-hooks.sh
#
# init.sh installs gates for USER projects; contributors working on the
# framework itself would otherwise have to hand-run a recipe from
# CONTRIBUTING.md, and discovering that at PR time means local commits never
# faced the gates CI enforces.
#
# ── BL-239: THIS SCRIPT USED TO INSTALL A NO-OP AND SAY OTHERWISE ───────────
# It did `cp scripts/pre-commit-gate.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit` and printed
# "Local commits now face the same gates CI runs." They faced NOTHING.
# `pre-commit-gate.sh` is a PreToolUse hook: with no flags it reads tool-input
# JSON on stdin and "no output" means ALLOW. Git invokes a pre-commit hook with
# NO arguments and no such JSON, so every commit took the allow path and exited
# 0 SILENTLY. Measured, hermetically, both ways on the same fixture commit:
#
#   cp the gate (the old behaviour)      -> commit rc=0, 0 lines of gate output
#   the hook init.sh generates (below)   -> commit rc=0, 3 lines: the gitleaks
#                                           and semgrep arms actually ran, and
#                                           semgrep reported SAST NOT ENFORCED
#                                           per `# BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN`
#
# A false claim inside the one script whose entire job is installing
# enforcement. That is why this now emits the SAME hooks init.sh does, from the
# SAME library — `scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh` is the one owner, so the
# contributor hook and the generated-project hook cannot drift:
#
#   .git/hooks/pre-commit   soif_write_precommit_hook       (gitleaks, SAST,
#                                                            test co-location,

#                                                            + BL-006 Build-Loop
#                                                            message check)
#
# The commit-msg half was previously not installed AT ALL for contributors, so
# the TDD-ordering gate and the Build-Loop message check never ran on a
# framework contributor's commits either.
#
# Idempotent — re-running refreshes both hooks to the current templates.
