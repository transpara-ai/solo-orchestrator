# scripts/host-drivers/gitlab.sh — GitLab driver.
# Uses `glab` CLI for creation and authentication, GitLab REST API v4 for protection.
# Supports both gitlab.com and self-hosted instances.
#
# AUDIT-DRIVEN ERROR-CODE CONTRACT (host_configure_protection)
#   0  success
#   1  invalid argument / origin parse failure
#   2  protected_branches POST failed (generic — upstream message surfaced)
#   3  approval-rules POST OR reset-approvals-on-push config POST failed
#      (generic — upstream message surfaced)
#   4  approval-rules POST failed because the feature is Premium-only on
#      gitlab.com Free tier (matched by the response body). Operators can't
#      fix the API call from this host/tier combo; the BL-032 remediation
#      message points them at upgrade / self-hosted / attestation options.
#
#   BL-152: the required-approvals call was migrated from the deprecated
#   `PUT projects/:id/approvals` + `approvals_before_merge` (scheduled for
#   removal in GitLab REST API v5) to `POST projects/:id/approval_rules`
#   with `approvals_required`. Exit codes 3/4 are unchanged; only the call
#   underneath them moved. The `reset_approvals_on_push` setting (which rode
#   on the old PUT payload) is re-applied via a dedicated
#   `POST projects/:id/approvals` CONFIG call after the rule succeeds — its
#   failure also returns 3. host_verify_protection likewise reads the count
#   from `GET projects/:id/approval_rules` (max approvals_required), not the
#   deprecated `approvals_before_merge` scalar.
#   5  project-settings PUT (only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds) failed
#      in org mode — upstream message surfaced.
#
# WHY GLAB STDERR IS CAPTURED (code-host-gitlab-3)
#   Pre-fix, both glab api calls used `>/dev/null 2>&1` and emitted only a
#   generic "failed to configure protection". Operators on gitlab.com Free
#   org mode would hit a Premium-feature-not-available 403 on the
#   approval-rules POST and see no actionable detail. The github.sh driver
#   already captures stderr (BL-002 pattern, github.sh:117-138) to detect
#   free-tier 403s; this driver now mirrors that discipline.
#
# WHY THE CI PIPELINE-SUCCESS GATE IS NOW SET (code-host-gitlab-2)
#   Baseline §3.2 establishes the org protection bar as "1+ PR review + CI
#   status checks". github.sh sets required_status_checks in org mode and
#   verifies it; pre-fix gitlab.sh did neither, so org-mode verification
#   passed silently with no CI gate on main. The org branch now PUTs
#   `only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds:true` on projects/:id (paired
#   with `only_allow_merge_if_all_discussions_are_resolved:true`) and
#   host_verify_protection asserts the same flag.
#
# WHY BL-032 EXISTS (code-host-gitlab-8)
#   Requiring MR approvals is a Premium-tier feature on gitlab.com — Free
#   tier returns 403 with a "not available on your plan" message. This
#   holds for both the deprecated `projects/:id/approvals`
#   (`approvals_before_merge`) endpoint and the current
#   `projects/:id/approval_rules` (`approvals_required`) endpoint that
#   BL-152 migrated the driver to. BL-032 in
#   solo-orchestrator-backlog.md mirrors BL-002 for GitHub free-tier:
#   document the gap, surface a clear remediation, and track the
#   attestation escape-hatch as future work. The driver's exit-4 branch
#   here surfaces the gap loudly with options, instead of returning the
#   bare exit-3 "approvals config failed" message.
