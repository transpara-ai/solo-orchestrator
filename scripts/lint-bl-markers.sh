# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh — BL-196 structural backstop for the repo's
# citation primitive: the grep-able `# BL-NNN-…` marker comment.
#
# THE DEFECT CLASS
#   CLAUDE.md § CITATION RULE makes the marker comment load-bearing: cite
#   code by a marker or a function name, NEVER by a bare file:line,
#   because line numbers mis-resolve within 24h. That makes every marker
#   an interface — and until this lint nothing validated it. A marker that
#   is renamed, typo'd, or deleted silently breaks every document that
#   points at it, and no lint, test or gate noticed. The worked example is
#   on `## BL-196:`: a marker cited in a closure paragraph was reported to
#   "exist nowhere", which was true of one commit and false of the commit
#   14 minutes later — a marker claim is stamped with a TREE, and the only
#   way to keep the stamp honest is to re-resolve it on every push.
#
# THE THREE PASSES (the shape `## BL-196:` prescribes)
#   (a) MARKER -> ENTRY. Every `# BL-NNN-…` marker comment in the code
#       surface names a `BL-NNN` that has a `## BL-NNN:` entry in
#       solo-orchestrator-backlog.md. Catches a marker minted against a
#       typo'd or nonexistent entry id. Measured on this branch,
#       2026-07-31: 86 distinct marker prefixes, 0 without an entry.
#       (86, not 85 — this lint's own test fixtures mint BL-196. Count it
#       with the recipe, never from memory: that off-by-one is exactly the
#       stamped-to-a-tree failure `## BL-196:` is about.)
#   (b) CITE -> MARKER. Every marker CITATION in the live prose surface
#       resolves to a marker token that actually exists in the code
#       surface. This is the core defect class: a cite in prose naming a
#       marker that no longer exists in code.
#   (c) VACUITY FLOOR. If a grep breaks (a regex edit, a moved directory,
#       a renamed surface), the scan would find nothing and "pass". Floors
#       on all THREE populations — markers, citations, backlog entry ids —
#       turn a silent no-op into a loud exit 2, and an EMPTY entry set is
#       refused outright before either join runs (# BL-196-EMPTY-SET-GUARD).
#       Measured on this branch, 2026-07-31: 285 marker tokens in the code
#       surface, 368 citations in the prose surface, 204 entry ids. The
#       floors sit well below all three so ordinary churn never trips them.
#
# THE CODE SURFACE (where a marker is DEFINED)
#   init.sh, scripts/, tests/, templates/, evaluation-prompts/, .github/ —
#   every file, any extension. These are the tree's executable and shipped
#   artifacts; a marker occurring in one of them is greppable and alive.
#   `## BL-196:` names only scripts/, tests/ and init.sh; the other three
#   are added because measurement found real marker families living there
#   (`# BL-128-*` in evaluation-prompts/Projects/run-reviews.sh,
#   `# BL-160-AUDIT-SCOPE` in templates/pipelines/ci/**) that a narrower
#   surface would have reported as broken citations. Widening the surface
#   makes pass (b) STRICTLY more conservative and leaves pass (a) green.
#
#   SELF-EXCLUSION: this script excludes ITSELF from the code surface. Its
#   allowlist below names withdrawn markers verbatim, and a lint that can
#   satisfy its own resolution check by mentioning a token in its own
#   allowlist would be self-certifying. Exclusion is by exact path, by the
#   `scripts/lint-bl-markers*.sh` rename shape, AND by a content sentinel,
#   so an arbitrarily-named COPY of this file cannot re-mint the allowlisted
#   tokens (`# BL-196-SELF-EXCLUDE-BEGIN`). Nothing else is excluded.
#
# THE PROSE SURFACE (where a marker is CITED)
#   CLAUDE.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, solo-orchestrator-backlog.md,
#   and docs/**/*.md EXCEPT docs/handoffs/archive/**.
#
#   DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE, and why — these are FROZEN artifacts, dated
#   and stamped to the tree they were written against. Editing one to
#   satisfy a lint would falsify the record, so a lint that reds on one is
#   pure cry-wolf:
#     • Reports/**                 — dogfood / audit run artifacts.
#     • docs/handoffs/archive/**   — superseded or fully-executed handoffs
#                                    (docs/handoffs/archive/README.md says
#                                    so explicitly).
#     • solo-orchestrator-bugs.md  — every entry is Fixed or Superseded by
#                                    construction; there is no live half.
#   CLOSED backlog entries ARE scanned. They are audit trail and must never
#   be deleted, but they are also where the BL-179 misattribution the entry
#   documents actually happened, and they sit in a file that is edited every
#   day — so a break there is both reachable and worth naming. Nothing in
#   this repo's closed entries is broken today except the two allowlisted
#   tokens below.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A CITATION (deliberately narrow — measured, not asserted)
#   Only a token that prose has explicitly marked as CODE:
#     1. backticked:      `BL-084-TIER-KEY`  or  `# BL-084-TIER-KEY`
#     2. hash-prefixed:   # BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE   (unbackticked, as it
#                         appears mid-sentence in several entries)
#   A BARE unbackticked, unhashed token is NOT a citation. Measured over
#   the whole prose surface (2026-07-31): 389 marker-shaped tokens, of
#   which 368 carry one of the two explicit shapes and 21 are bare. ELEVEN
#   of those 21 are ordinary prose hyphenation, not citations at all —
#   BL-140-family, BL-137-class, BL-122-correct, BL-030-edit, BL-090-style,
#   BL-101-generator (left unbackticked HERE too, for the same reason).
#   Treating the bare shape as a citation would make this lint a cry-wolf
#   machine on day one.
#   NAMED RESIDUAL, since the trade is not free: the other TEN bare hits
#   ARE real markers written without backticks (BL-084-TIER-KEY,
#   BL-073-ESCALATE, BL-107-UNIVERSAL-INSTALL, BL-170-APPEND-DESIGN, …)
#   and this lint does not check them. Backtick a marker and it becomes
#   enforced; the fix for the residual is to backtick, not to widen the
#   regex — widening cannot separate the two halves, the shapes are
#   identical.
#
#   `# BL-NNN-…` (the literal placeholder CLAUDE.md uses to describe the
#   convention) never matches: `NNN` is not digits.
#
# HOW A CITATION RESOLVES
#   • EXACT: the token appears verbatim somewhere in the code surface.
#   • FAMILY: `TOKEN-` prefixes some code token. This is what makes a cite
#     of a FENCE family resolve — prose writes `# BL-105-PHASE4-GATE` while
#     the code carries `-BEGIN` / `-END` — and what makes the glob form
#     `# BL-102-MARKET-SIGNAL-*` resolve. A trailing `-` or `*` on the
#     cited token is stripped before lookup for the same reason. Note the
#     family rule requires the HYPHEN: a truncation typo (`…-TIER-KE` for
#     `…-TIER-KEY`) still fails, because `BL-084-TIER-KE-` prefixes nothing.
#
# ALLOWLIST — two mechanisms, both requiring a reason
#   1. INLINE, preferred: put `<!-- lint-bl-markers: allow <reason> -->`
#      (or `# lint-bl-markers: allow <reason>` in code) on the CITING line.
#      An empty reason FAILS, matching the allowlist semantics of
#      lint-counter-antipattern.sh and lint-backlog-references.sh.
#   2. SCRIPT-LEVEL, for cites in a file this change may not edit: the
#      ALLOWLIST table below. Every row carries its reason and is rendered
#      in --list, so it is reviewable.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 — every marker resolves to an entry and every citation to a marker.
#   1 — one or more violations found.
#   2 — invocation / I/O error, OR the vacuity floor tripped (pass c).
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh              # quiet pass/fail
#   bash scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh --list       # PASS/FAIL table
#   bash scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh --root DIR   # test-mode: scan an
#       alternate tree (used by tests/test-lint-bl-markers.sh). Under
#       --root the vacuity floors default to 0 — a fixture is SUPPOSED to
#       be small — and can be raised explicitly with the flags below so the
#       floor itself stays testable.
#   bash scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh --min-markers N --min-cites N \
#        --min-entries N
#
# BASH 3.2 COMPATIBILITY
#   macOS ships bash 3.2.57 as /bin/bash. No associative arrays, no
#   ${var,,}, no `((x++))` under set -e. Sets are temp files; the two
#   resolution joins are single awk passes over two files, discriminated by
#   `FILENAME == ARGV[1]` and deliberately NOT by the `NR==FNR` idiom —
#   `NR==FNR` is TRUE for every record of the second file when the first is
#   empty, which turned both joins into silent no-ops. No shell variable is
#   ever interpolated into an awk program — awk reads its inputs, never `-v`.

# Script-level allowlist: `TOKEN|reason`. Used only where the citing file
# is one this change will not rewrite to satisfy a lint. Every row is
# rendered by --list.
#
# The two rows below are the ONLY broken citations on the tree as of
# 2026-07-31, and both are deliberate: `## BL-192:` records that the
# BL-186 parse-coverage clause and its five test cases were WITHDRAWN from
# main and live on the unmerged branch `fix/bl112-sast-scan-coverage`
# (`e87dbd3`), to be restored only with a decode check that does not
# depend on semgrep's `Parsed lines`. Entries BL-186, BL-189 and BL-192
# all cite them as not-on-this-tree on purpose. That is BL-196's own
# lesson — a marker claim is stamped with a tree — so the citations are
# correct and it is this lint that must yield.
#
# WHEN `fix/bl112-sast-scan-coverage` MERGES, do BOTH of these:
#   1. delete the two rows below — the tokens then resolve by exact match
#      and the rows become dead weight; and
#   2. re-read `T-REPO-LIST` in tests/test-lint-bl-markers.sh. That case
#      asserts the allowlist MECHANISM is live, and rows only render on a
#      MISS — so the merge alone changes what it observes. It is written to
#      accept EITHER a rendered allowlist row OR every allowlisted token
#      resolving EXACT (and it is vacuously satisfied once the rows are
#      gone), so the ORDER does not matter and neither step reds the unit
#      lane on its own. Do not tighten it back to "at least one row".

#
# THREE LAYERS, because an exact-path exclusion is trivially defeated.
# A COPY of this script anywhere in the code surface re-mints every
# allowlisted token, and every allowlisted citation then resolves EXACT —
# a silent, whole-check bypass that no diagnostic mentions:
#   1. the exact self path;
#   2. any `scripts/lint-bl-markers*.sh` — the rename/backup shape
#      (`lint-bl-markers.sh.bak`, `lint-bl-markers-v2.sh`);
#   3. ANY file in the surface carrying the sentinel string below,
#      whatever it is called. This is the layer that catches
#      `cp scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh scripts/zz-copy.sh`: the copy
#      carries the sentinel because the sentinel is part of the file.
# Layer 3 subsumes 1 and 2 for honest copies; 1 and 2 stay because they
# cost nothing and still hold if someone strips the sentinel line — but
# READ THAT NARROWLY: it holds only for a copy whose PATH still matches
# layer 1 or 2. A de-sentinelled copy under an arbitrary name defeats all
# three, and no layer here detects it. That residual is deliberate and is
# the sabotage class, not the accident class: every layer above is aimed
# at a copy someone made in good faith (a backup, a rename, an
# experiment). Nothing in this lint is a defence against an author who is
# actively editing it to lie.
# T16 in tests/test-lint-bl-markers.sh is the canary for layer 3, and its
# control arm is exactly the de-sentinelled copy — so the residual is
