# scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh — BL-070 Phase 3 validation-scan driver.
# ALL FIVE registered scanners are now REAL (BL-070 completed 2026-07-10):
# semgrep-full-tree, license, snyk, zap-dast, threat-model. The tool-backed
# arms (semgrep / license / snyk / zap-dast) detect-and-run-if-available and
# SKIP under --offline so the gate autorun stays hermetic and instant; the
# pure-local threat-model arm runs even offline. Nothing is stubbed-by-decision.
# See the SCANNER REGISTRY notes below for each arm's detect/run/SKIP contract.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The Builder's/User guides + workflow.html imply Phase 3 automatically
#   runs Snyk (deps), license compliance, full-tree Semgrep SAST, OWASP ZAP
#   DAST, and threat-model verification. A grep of scripts/ found ZERO
#   invocations of any of these tools — a documented gate mechanic that was
#   not real. BL-070 (Karl-approved Option C) builds the DRIVER + GATE first,
#   every scanner SKIP-able, and adds real scanners incrementally.
#
# ATTEST-ON-SKIP (Karl's refinement)
#   When a scanner is unavailable/SKIP, the operator decides whether to
#   download + run it manually. ANY skipped scanner requires an attestation
#   (a reason AND a sign-off) recorded in
#   `.claude/phase-state.json::phase3.attestations.<scanner>`. A non-attested
#   SKIP counts as a gate FAIL. Mirrors the BL-032 escape-hatch pattern and
#   reuses BL-071's atomic-finalize write pattern (mkdir-lock + adjacent
#   mktemp + rename) so the state write is race-safe on macOS bash-3.2.
#
# GATE INTEGRATION
#   scripts/check-phase-gate.sh auto-invokes this driver on the Phase 3→4
#   check and refuses the transition unless the aggregate summary exists AND
#   every scanner is PASS or attested-skip-with-signoff (zero un-attested
#   SKIPs, zero FAILs). See the `# BL-070-GATE-CHECK` block in that script.
#
# SUMMARY PROVENANCE — tree binding (BL-082, 2026-07-09)
#   The summary header records the tree it validated so a stale summary cannot
#   satisfy the gate forever:
#       - tree: <git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}>   (or `none` outside a git repo)
#       - dirty: yes|no                        (scoped working-tree state)
#   `dirty` comes from a SCOPED `git status --porcelain` that EXCLUDES the
#   framework's OWN write surfaces — `.claude/` (this driver writes
#   attestations, and check-phase-gate.sh writes the BL-071 gate date, into
#   .claude/phase-state.json, which is TRACKED in downstream projects — the
#   generated .gitignore covers `test-results/` but not `.claude/`) and the
#   --results-dir (where this summary + scan archives land). WHY the scoping
#   (Karl-approved correction, 2026-07-09): an UNSCOPED dirty check would read
#   the tree as dirty the instant the gate writes phase-state.json on its first
#   PASS, marking every summary permanently stale (self-defeating; with
#   SOLO_PHASE3_GATE_NOAUTORUN=1 it bricks the gate). check-phase-gate.sh
#   re-checks freshness against the CURRENT tree AND live scoped porcelain and
#   regenerates when stale. Pre-BL-082 summaries have no `tree:` line and are
#   treated as STALE (backward compat).
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh [--offline] [--results-dir DIR]
#                                         [--state FILE]
#   bash scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh --attest <scanner> \
#                                         --reason "<why skipped>" \
#                                         [--signoff "<who>"]
#   bash scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh --list
#   bash scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh --help
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 — every scanner PASS or attested-skip (gate-ready), or --attest/--list
#       succeeded.
#   1 — at least one un-attested SKIP or a scanner FAIL (the gate would
#       block Phase 3→4).
#   2 — usage / precondition error (bad flag, jq missing for --attest).
#
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no `${var^^}`.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BL-113 — NO LAUNDERING: a real FAIL is never downgraded to a fresh SKIP.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE DEFECT (walk finding F15). The 3→4 gate autoruns THIS driver with
# `--offline` whenever the working tree is dirty — the NORMAL state while the
# operator is authoring Phase-3 artifacts. `--offline` SKIPs every tool-backed
# scanner. So a scanner whose last REAL result was a FAIL (walk finding F14:
# semgrep FAILed on a fresh scaffold) was silently rewritten to SKIP, the
# operator attested the SKIP in good faith ("scanner unavailable"), and the
# gate passed. A FAIL is NOT attestable; a SKIP is. The offline autorun was
# the laundry.
#
# THE INVARIANT (marker `# BL-113-NO-LAUNDER`): a SKIP must never overwrite a
# prior REAL verdict of FAIL. When a scanner SKIPs, this driver looks back at
# the most recent summary that recorded a REAL (non-SKIP) verdict for that
# scanner. If that verdict was FAIL, the SKIP is REFUSED: the status is
# recorded as FAIL with a `[STALE - last real result: FAIL]` note plus a
# machine-readable `CARRIED <scanner> <origin>` line, so the gate blocks and
# the operator is told, in words, that the scan they are about to attest away
# was really run and really failed.
#
# WHY NOT "just run semgrep under the offline autorun" (option (i))? VERIFIED
# FALSE PREMISE: `semgrep --config auto` is NOT local-only. It hard-fetches its
# ruleset from https://semgrep.dev/c/auto and has NO local cache fallback — with
# the network blackholed it spends ~97s retrying, exits rc=2, and writes no
# report. Running it from the gate's autorun would therefore (a) make the gate
# non-hermetic and network-dependent, (b) add minutes to every dirty-tree gate
# run, and (c) brick genuinely-offline operators. The autorun stays `--offline`;
# the LAUNDERING is what dies, not the offline mode.
#
# OFFLINE MUST STAY USABLE. An honest "no tool / no network" SKIP remains
# attestable (that is what makes the framework work on a plane). Two supports:
#   * `_p3_scan_semgrep` now reports a registry-unreachable run as an honest
#     SKIP rather than a FAIL (see `# BL-113-SEMGREP-OFFLINE`), so an operator
#     with semgrep installed but no network can still produce a real, honest,
#     attestable non-result by running the driver WITHOUT --offline.
#   * The carry-forward below only fires when a REAL FAIL was actually observed.
#
# _p3_last_real_verdict <scanner> — echo "<PASS|FAIL> <origin-summary>" for the
# most recent summary in RESULTS_DIR that recorded a REAL (non-SKIP) verdict for
# <scanner>; echo "" when none exists. `CARRIED` provenance is preserved so the
# origin of a carried FAIL does not drift forward each run. Never returns
# non-zero (the verdict is the echoed string).

# BL-086 — tier-keyed license-policy DENY enforcement (2026-07-11)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The BL-070 `license` arm INVENTORIES licenses (runs the per-language tool,
# archives the report, PASSes on a non-empty report). BL-086 adds a DENY
# POLICY on top, applied AFTER the inventory is archived (archive naming and
# BL-082 provenance are UNCHANGED — this only reads the archive back and, on a
# blocked-tier attestation, appends to phase-state.json under .claude/, which
# the BL-082 scoped-dirty check already excludes so it cannot re-mark the
# summary stale).
#
# DEFAULT DENY LIST — strong copyleft only. These are start-with STEMS matched
# against whole license TOKENS (see _p3_token_denied). Token start-with
# matching is inherently prefix/boundary-safe: "LGPL-3.0" is a single token
# that does NOT start with "GPL" (it starts with "L"), so an LGPL / MPL / EPL
# id can NEVER match a GPL stem — the prefix-safety the design requires, free.
#   GPL-2.0*  GPL-3.0*   GNU GPL v2 / v3 (all suffixes: -only / -or-later / +)
#   AGPL-1.0* AGPL-3.0*  GNU Affero GPL (copyleft triggers on network use alone)
#   SSPL-1.0             MongoDB Server Side Public License
#   GPL   AGPL           bare acronyms some tools emit ("GPLv3", "AGPLv3")
# EXPLICITLY NOT DENIED: LGPL-* (weak copyleft), MPL-*, EPL-*, and every
# permissive license (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-*, ISC, ...). Framework stance:
# block STRONG copyleft on the corporate track; the rest is the operator's
# call. Override the whole list via the .claude/license-policy.json DATA file.
#
# POLICY OVERRIDE (optional DATA file — NEVER a sourced script, so the BL-088
# source-closure check stays green): .claude/license-policy.json read via jq:
#     { "deny": ["SPDX-STEM", ...], "allow_packages": ["pkg", ...] }
#   • deny (when the key is PRESENT) REPLACES the default stem list entirely
#     (an empty array therefore denies nothing — a deliberate operator choice).
#   • allow_packages exempts named packages by name (the commercial-license
#     case): "pkg" matches an exact package name OR "pkg@<version>".
#   Malformed JSON → a LOUD scanner FAIL (never a silent skip of the policy).

# ── threat-model helpers (BL-070 increment, WP-B2) ───────────────────
# A "threat row" is a Markdown table line (carries a `|`) bearing a TM-NNN id.
# Threats live in PROJECT_BIBLE.md Section 4; the Phase-3 VALIDATION REPORT

# TM-ID plus an Unmitigated table whose accepted risks each need an approver.

# BL-168-TM-SIGPIPE: this was a two-stage `grep '|' | grep -Eq TM-…` pipeline.
# Under this script's `set -uo pipefail`, the downstream -q exits on its first
# match and closes the pipe; when the file's `|`-line output exceeds one grep
# stdout buffer, the upstream grep dies SIGPIPE (141) mid-write and pipefail
# read a PRESENT table as "absent" — an intermittent false un-attested SKIP
# that blocked the CI gate on identical trees (~11% of live attempts; runs
# 29949089493 att.7 / 29951076488 att.1). One grep = no pipe = no race; the
