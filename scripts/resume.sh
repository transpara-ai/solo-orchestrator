# ── DELTA-RESUME-BEGIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE FOURTH BRANCH (design 2026-08-02-delta-track-v1 §10.5), ahead of the
# classic one.
#
# D8's point, and the reason this is the branch that matters: today's post-1.0
# workflow instructions are RETRIEVAL surfaces — the guide and the ledger
# headers — correct, and unread at the moment of need. A greeting changes WHEN
# the operator learns the rule, from after they act to before. §10.5 marks its
# tier honestly: ADVISORY. A greeting cannot make anyone do anything.
#
# Two sub-cases, and no others:
#   current_phase == 4 and something open  -> resume THAT piece of work: its
#     id, class, confirmed attributes, and what is still outstanding.
#   current_phase == 4 and nothing open    -> the post-1.0 greeting: how to
#     state a need in plain words, any overdue maintenance, any write-up still
#     owed, and how many candidates the manifesto's § 6 is holding.
#
# WHY IT GOES THROUGH THE SEAM AND NAMES NO MODULE FILE. This is a CORE script,
# and the post-1.0 module is severable: core may never reference it
# (scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh, §3.3 clause 2). So this block reads the
# record by delegating to scripts/process-checklist.sh — a core file, and the
# ONE declared seam — exactly as scripts/validate.sh, scripts/upgrade-project.sh
# and scripts/check-maintenance.sh already do. It names the seam's action FLAG
# and never a module path, so tier T1 stays clean and the seam allowlist stays
# at cardinality one.
#
# AND IT FAILS SOFT, which is what keeps the module severable rather than
# merely separate. With the module absent the seam answers non-zero, the
# document is empty, and control falls through to the classic prompt below —
# no crash, no half-greeting. That is the same fail-soft contract the other
# four core consumers carry, measured by the severability suite's V0.
#
# The whole block is contiguous between these two markers so the sever is a
# single-block revert, like the seam's own fence.
