# Session Handoff — S3 Arc Close (2026-07-01)

## Executive Summary

The multi-wave S3 remediation arc that ran from 2026-06-28 through 2026-07-01 is **effectively closed**. All Critical, High, and Medium-tier backlog items that had a code fix in scope have shipped. What remains is a mix of design/investigation work (BL-001), a large mechanical pass (BL-035), a follow-up on this arc's own schema shipment (BL-069), and ~15 Low/Minor cleanups awaiting a prune decision.

**Current state**: main is at commit `af0e93a`, no open PRs, no active workflows, backlog file lists 69 entries (BL-001..BL-069, with gaps at BL-026/027/028). The next session should start with a fresh-eyes review of what's left before dispatching further waves.

## What shipped this arc (S1/S2/S3 waves)

### S1 · Critical (1/1 closed)
| BL | PR | Note |
|---|---|---|
| BL-036 | #110 | Fix vacuous edge-case assertions (E31/E32/E39) — the defect class that spawned the double-mutation pattern |

### S2 · High/Major (7/7 closed)
| BL | PR |
|---|---|
| BL-034 (test wiring) | #111 |
| BL-037 (major vacuous asserts) | #115 |
| BL-039 (LB-1 / BL-016 non-interactive init) | #117 |
| BL-044 (TEST 4 stale template paths) | #113 |
| BL-045 (parallelize TEST 1 resolver matrix) | #114 |
| BL-064 (init.sh silent-success defect) | #118 |
| code-check-gates-7 follow-up | #116 + #119 |

### S3 Wave A (3/3 closed)

|---|---|
| BL-046 (split helpers.sh into focused libs) | #125 |
| BL-050 (verify-install.sh eval-factory gate) | #126 |
| BL-053 (TEST 4 fixture sharing) | #128 |

### S3 Wave C (4/4 closed — includes BL-068 residual from #125)
| BL | PR |
|---|---|
| BL-068 (T5/T5b vacuous — the residual PR #125 fix) | #129 |
| BL-059 (validate.sh JSON-first) | #130 (+ tightening `8e5c837`) |
| BL-060 (check-phase-gate --gate argv) | #132 |
| BL-061 (manifest.json::deployment refresh) | #131 |

### S3 Wave D (3/3 closed — BL-032 tightened same-branch)
| BL | PR |
|---|---|
| BL-067 (lint-tests-registered runtime — 6.1× speedup verified) | #133 |

| BL | PR |
|---|---|
| BL-065 (E30 characterization) | #121 |
| BL-066 (host-drivers e2e characterization) | #121 |

### Characterization / Won't Fix
- **BL-058** — Sponsored POC APPROVAL_LOG shape (doc-only, Won't Fix + doc tightening in PR #108)
- **BL-055** — Per-line blame walker — Closed with rationale (shipped via PR #116 + #119, T-blame-1..4 as regression cohort)

### Non-backlog wins this arc
- **workflow.html** — Visio-style journey diagram at repo root (PR #135); README has the link block near the top; GitHub Pages toggle still pending Karl
- **backlog reconciliation** — 60+ entry backlog file established as source of truth (`solo-orchestrator-backlog.md`)

**Arc totals**: ~24 backlog entries closed, ~20 PRs merged, ~4 workflows dispatched, ~8 individual follow-up agents.

---

## Discipline patterns validated this arc (keep using)

1. **Impl+adversarial-verify pipeline** — every code-fix PR spawns an implementer agent (worktree-isolated) and an adversarial reviewer agent tuned to REFUTE. Rubric: `block` / `major_concerns` / `minor_concerns` / `approve`.
2. **Double-mutation pattern** — implementer provides one mutation proof in the PR body; verifier runs a DIFFERENT mutation. If the verifier's mutation passes when it shouldn't, that's a scope-miss even if the implementer's proof was real.
3. **Wall-clock claim discipline** — for perf claims, independent median measurement is mandatory. >30% disagreement between implementer and verifier = grade UP.
4. **Defer-status-flip-to-second-commit** — first commit fixes the bug, second commit flips backlog status. Keeps the audit trail on the fix separable from the housekeeping.
5. **Test-aggregator wiring invariant (BL-034)** — every new test file MUST be registered in an aggregator. `scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh` enforces (fast now, post BL-067).
6. **BL-036/BL-068 defect class awareness** — an assertion that would pass even if the guarded behavior were removed is `major_concerns` at minimum. Test failure paths, not just success paths.
7. **Tightener-on-same-branch pattern** — when verifier posts `minor_concerns` "no block", push a tightener commit to the same PR branch (don't open a new PR); post a verifier-response comment. Used for PR #130 and PR #134 this arc.

---

## What's Open — ranked

### Medium (real S3-tier work remaining)
1. **BL-001** — CDF sync mechanism audit. Investigation/design task, NOT a code fix. Best approach: Explore-first recon before any implementation, similar to the BL-055 recon that closed cleanly this arc.
2. **BL-035** — Wire ~50 pre-Wave-1-4 orphan tests into aggregators. Mechanical but large surface. Same pattern as BL-034 which shipped clean. Probably its own wave with a chunking strategy (5-10 files per sub-agent).
3. **BL-069** — Migrate install_cmds array consumers off legacy singular. Just filed 2026-07-01 as PR #136 follow-up. 3 readers + 3 wrapper scripts (gitleaks/rust/k6). Natural continuation of BL-033.

### Major — filed 2026-07-01 after workflow.html validation (PR #137) with automation-first solutions proposed; awaiting Karl's discussion

**Design principle Karl reiterated at filing:** *users shouldn't have to ask the orchestrator to run evals — those should be automatic — and gate checks should be real, not implied.*

4. **BL-070** — **Phase 3 validation scans not actually invoked.** Docs claim Phase 3 auto-runs Snyk / OWASP ZAP / full-tree Semgrep / license-compliance / threat-model verification. `grep of scripts/` finds zero invocations. Proposed solution: `scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh` driver invoked by `check-phase-gate.sh` that actually runs each tool, archives outputs to `docs/test-results/phase3/`, and gates the transition on aggregate summary + zero criticals.
5. **BL-071** — **`phase-state.json::gates.<gate>` auto-write not implemented.** Docs say the gate script writes today's date on PASS. Reality: only READS. Proposed: atomic write per PR #97 pattern + fix `init.sh:1789-1804` to seed all 4 gate keys (currently misses `phase_2_to_3`).
6. **BL-072** — **TDD ordering is warning-only, not blocking.** `init.sh:2337-2347` hook + `pre-commit-gate.sh` BL-006 only enforce on `feat:` prefix. Proposed: hard-block on `feat:`/`fix:`/`refactor:` when source outside `tests/` is touched without a matching test in the diff, with an attestation escape hatch.
7. **BL-073** — **Phase 3 → 4 review-manifest gate is WARN-only.** `check-phase-gate.sh:1039-1056` doesn't verify all six reviewers ran. Proposed: track-aware escalation — `track=full` FAILs if Security or Red Team missing (per builders-guide.md L1656), `track=light` (POC) stays WARN.

### Minor
- **BL-062** — Step-5 walker grading rubric (documentation)
- **BL-063** — Enforcement-point scenario contracts assert message-present, not message-only (documentation)

### Low (batch-prune candidates)
- **BL-010/011/012/013/014** — Optional Build Loop enforcements (all currently marked "evaluate when concrete need arises")
- **BL-019** — verify-install.sh non-interactive audit
- **BL-023** — Rev3 runbook `$GOV` unquoted expansion
- **BL-025** — Phase 2 init-verified state setup helper for tests
- **BL-042** — init.sh prompt_install pipefail with closed stdin (workaround in place)
- **BL-047** — Retire the disabled `cli` arm of verify-install.sh
- **BL-048** — Repair dead user-guide anchors
- **BL-049** — Delete orphan plan docs under `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- **BL-051** — Memoize get_available_platforms in resolve-tools.sh
- **BL-052** — Retire un-invoked test aggregators (POLICY DECISION pending)
- **BL-054** — Tiny dead-code cleanup pass

### Parked (no action expected)
- **BL-017** — intake-wizard non-interactive mode (parked 2026-06-29; no operator demand across 4 waves)

## Post-merge action items — status at session close

1. ✅ **GitHub Pages** — enabled and tested working. `https://kraulerson.github.io/solo-orchestrator/workflow.html` is live.
2. ✅ **PR #137 merged** — workflow.html has governance/signoff/audit-trail additions; `Reports/2026-07-01-workflow-html-validation.md` flags report is on main.
3. ⏳ **Local branch cleanup — partial**. Karl will delete these 3 in Terminal (bash tool blocked destructive git ops in this session):
   ```
   cd "/Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator"
   git branch -D docs/v2-concepts-mcp-server-and-auto-discovery feat/process-enforcement fix/qdrant-usage-guidance
   git push origin --delete fix/qdrant-usage-guidance
   ```
4. ⏳ **Dogfood test repos** — Karl is handling `kraulerson/dog-*` + `kraulerson/foo` himself.

## Broader stale-branch cleanup (not in original scope — flagged for a future decision)

Current `git branch --list` shows dozens of stale local branches beyond the 3 named:

- **Merged-PR fix/perf/refactor branches** (~25 items — `fix/bl034-*`, `fix/bl036-*`, `fix/bl037-*`, `fix/bl039-*` etc; all closed via merged PRs earlier this arc)
- **`worktree-*` branches** (~25 items — auto-created by ultracode workflows; can be pruned via `git worktree prune` + `git branch -D worktree-*`)
- **`pr-*-review` branches** (~6 items — `pr-111-review`, `pr-114-check`, `pr-117-review`, `pr-125-review`, `pr113-review`, `pr133`)
- **Remote-side** has ~110 `origin/*` branches; a `git fetch --prune` will drop the ones no longer on GitHub.

None of these will cause harm sitting there. Suggested single-command cleanup (for a future terminal session, not now):

```bash
# Prune all worktrees that no longer have a working directory
git worktree prune

# Drop remote-tracking branches that no longer exist upstream
git fetch --prune

# Optional: bulk-delete local branches that are fully merged into main
git branch --merged main | grep -vE '^\s*(main|\*)' | xargs -r git branch -d

# Aggressive: delete every fix/*/perf/*/refactor/* whose commits are already on main
git branch | grep -E '^\s*(fix|perf|refactor)/bl0[3-6][0-9]' | xargs git branch -D
```

## Session handoff prompts

Paste one of these into the fresh session. The first loads context so the assistant knows where we are; the second kicks off the fresh-eyes review Karl requested at the end of this session.

### Prompt 1 · Load context (paste FIRST in the new session)

```
I'm resuming the solo-orchestrator SDLC remediation arc. Load full context
before doing anything.

Read these in order, then summarize what you see:

1. Reports/2026-07-01-s3-arc-close-and-handoff.md — the handoff report from
   the previous session (this is the primary context document)
2. solo-orchestrator-backlog.md — the backlog source of truth (~69 entries;
   BL-001..BL-069 with gaps at BL-026/027/028)
3. Recent commits: `git log --oneline -20`
4. Any open PRs: `gh pr list --state open`
5. Any active branches: `git branch --list`

Confirm you understand:
- The multi-wave S3 arc is closed. Main is at HEAD (should be commit
  2e1491e or later — check `git log -1`). No open PRs; PR #137
  (workflow.html validation) and PR #135 (workflow.html initial) are
  both merged. GitHub Pages is live at
  https://kraulerson.github.io/solo-orchestrator/workflow.html.
- The Open Medium items are BL-001 (CDF sync audit / investigation),
  BL-035 (~50 orphan test wirings / mechanical), and BL-069 (install_cmds
  consumer migration / natural PR #136 follow-up).
- Four NEW Major items were filed 2026-07-01 after the workflow.html
  validation flagged doc-vs-enforcement gaps — BL-070 (Phase 3 scans
  not invoked), BL-071 (gate date auto-write missing), BL-072 (TDD
  warn-only not blocking), BL-073 (review-manifest WARN not FAIL). All
  four have "SOLUTION PROPOSED, awaiting discussion" Status and an
  automation-first solution in their entries. DO NOT dispatch fixes for
  these without discussing the proposed solutions with me first.
- The Low/Minor bucket has ~15 entries awaiting a prune decision.
- Auto-memory (~/.claude/projects/...memory/MEMORY.md) has patterns from
  the prior arc: push back on decisions, ultracode discipline, workflows
  for parallel impl+verify, adversarial-verify class defects, cross-repo
  fix preference, CDF integration layout.

Do NOT dispatch any work yet. After the summary, wait for my next prompt.
```

### Prompt 2 · Fresh-eyes review (paste SECOND, after Prompt 1 lands)

```
Now do a fresh-eyes review of what remains in the backlog. Karl (me) asked
for this pause before more autonomous work.

Deliverable — a single response covering:

1. **The 3 remaining Medium items** — for each of BL-001, BL-035, BL-069,
   a one-paragraph scoping: effort estimate (small/medium/large), risk
   profile (safe/moderate/architectural), any dependencies on other items,
   and whether it needs recon before implementation.

2. **The 4 Major items filed 2026-07-01** — for each of BL-070, BL-071,
   BL-072, BL-073, review the proposed automation-first solution and
   report: (a) does the solution actually address the design principle
   ("evals should be automatic, gate checks real not implied")?
   (b) any risks or dependencies I should think about before approving
   dispatch? (c) which order would you do them in? DO NOT propose
   dispatch — just review the proposed solutions and flag concerns.

3. **The Low/Minor bucket** — group the ~15 entries into three buckets:
   - "Worth shipping" — small enough to batch into a single sweep wave
   - "Defer explicitly" — file a defer rationale, keep Open, revisit next quarter
   - "Won't Fix candidate" — no operator demand, no defect class risk
   For each, cite the BL number and a one-line rationale for the bucket.

4. **Recommended tempo** — given (a) the audit-remediation arc's momentum
   is intact but every wave since Wave A has surfaced verifier-caught
   coverage gaps requiring tightener commits, (b) BL-035 alone is
   ~50 files worth of mechanical wiring, and (c) BL-070..BL-073 are
   design-principle-critical automation gaps that likely warrant
   priority over the Medium items, recommend ONE of:
   - Another impl+verify wave (which slots?)
   - A batch-close doc-only sweep (which BLs, in one commit?)
   - A recon-first cycle (BL-001 first, everything else after)
   - Something else you'd argue for

Push back if any of my instincts (or the report's ranking) look wrong. The
memory file `feedback_pushback.md` covers this — I want you to challenge,
not agree.

Do NOT dispatch a workflow yet. Give me the review; I'll decide.
```
