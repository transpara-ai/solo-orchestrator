# Solo Orchestrator Framework

A structured software development methodology where a single technically literate person builds MVP-grade applications using AI as the execution layer. The human defines intent, constraints, and validation. The AI generates architecture, code, tests, and documentation within those constraints. Applications are built with production practices (TDD, security scanning, documentation) and structured for production readiness through subsequent refinement.

This is not vibe coding. It's a phase-gated, test-driven, documentation-mandatory process with security scanning, threat modeling, and incident response built in.

### AI Agent: Claude Code

**This framework is built on and tested with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic).** The init script, CLAUDE.md configuration, Superpowers plugin, MCP server integrations, and CLI Setup Addendum are all Claude Code-specific.

The methodology itself — the phases, TDD discipline, threat modeling, documentation mandates, and security scanning — is agent-agnostic and works with any sufficiently capable AI coding agent. The operational automation layer that makes the autonomous workflow practical is Claude Code. See [Methodology vs. Tooling: What's Portable](#methodology-vs-tooling-whats-portable) for migration details.

> **How much do you need to read?** About 30 minutes to set up and get oriented. The [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) walks you through everything step by step — read each section as you reach that step, not all at once. The [Intake Wizard](scripts/intake-wizard.sh) guides you through your project definition interactively. Your [Platform Module](docs/platform-modules/) is reference material for your specific platform. That's it. The Builder's Guide, Governance Framework, and other documents are a reference library — the User Guide points you to them at the right moment. You don't read them upfront. All framework documents are machine-readable — you can load them into any AI assistant and ask questions instead of reading them manually.

---

## Start Here: The User Guide

**Read the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) first.** It walks you through the entire process from setup to first release — what you do at each step, what external approvals you need, and what to expect as output. It has two parallel paths:

- **Personal projects** — lightweight, no governance overhead, start building immediately
- **Organizational deployments** — full approval chain, external stakeholder interactions, audit trail. Includes POC modes (Sponsored and Private) to validate the framework before completing all governance approvals.

The User Guide is your operating manual. The other documents (Builder's Guide, Governance Framework, Platform Modules, Security Scan Guide, Evaluation Prompts) are reference material the guide points you to at the right time. The [Intake Wizard](docs/user-guide.md#using-the-intake-wizard) guides you through filling out your project definition.

Three further pages cover what happens outside the five-phase build — [The Delta Track](docs/delta-track.md) (life after v1.0), [Scout](docs/scout.md) (a read-only look at a codebase you already have) and [Brownfield Adoption](docs/adoption.md) (bringing that codebase in). See [The Three Modules](#the-three-modules) below.

**Want to see what it produces?** The [Example Project](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator-example-project) contains the complete artifact trail from building [MeshScope](https://github.com/kraulerson/meshscope) — a cross-platform 3D mesh viewer. Browse the artifacts from each phase to see what the framework produces before you commit to using it.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator.git
cd solo-orchestrator
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh --project-dir my-project
```

**Where your project lands.** `--project-dir my-project` — a bare folder name —
creates the project **next to the clone**, as a sibling of `solo-orchestrator/`,
not inside it. Clone into `~/Code` and you get `~/Code/my-project/` alongside
`~/Code/solo-orchestrator/`. Give an **absolute path** instead
(`./init.sh --project-dir ~/work/my-project`) and it is used exactly as written,
anywhere outside the framework. Running plain `./init.sh` with no flags still
works and prompts you interactively — the directory question defaults to that
same sibling path, so you can just press Enter. The one thing init will refuse
is a target that would write onto the framework itself: the clone, anything
inside it, or another copy of solo-orchestrator.

> **Preview first?** Run `./init.sh --dry-run` to see what will be installed and created without making any changes.

The init script will:
1. Check prerequisites — offers to auto-install Git, Node.js, and your language runtime if missing
2. Collect your project information (name, platform, track, language)
3. Install security tooling (Semgrep, gitleaks, Snyk, Claude Code, Lighthouse)
4. Create your project directory with all framework documents, platform module, and utility scripts
5. Generate `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, CI pipeline, release pipeline, and approval log
6. Initialize Git and run a health check
7. Print your next steps

**After init completes:**
1. Authenticate: `claude` (OAuth) and `snyk auth`
2. Fill out the Intake: run `bash scripts/intake-wizard.sh` for a guided walkthrough (interactive script or AI-assisted conversation), or open `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` directly. For **personal or Private POC projects only**, you can paste the intake form into your AI of choice and work with it to fill out the sections — but read through the result yourself to verify accuracy. Do not use this shortcut for organizational or production projects where intake accuracy drives compliance decisions.
3. For organizational deployments: complete governance pre-conditions — or use a POC mode (Sponsored or Private) to defer non-technical approvals while you validate the framework
4. Start Claude Code **from inside your generated project directory** — and let
   your project print its own first message rather than composing one by hand:
   ```bash
   cd ../my-project         # the SIBLING init created, not the framework clone
   bash scripts/resume.sh   # prints the exact first message — copy it
   claude                   # paste it as your very first message
   ```
   `scripts/resume.sh` is copied into your project by the init script, so it
   **does not exist in this framework repo** — it becomes available once init
   has created your project, and not before. The same is true of everything the
   message it prints will name (`CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`,
   `docs/reference/`, `.claude/`): those live in your generated project.

   The script is state-aware, so the message is right wherever you actually
   stopped:
   - **Intake not finished** — a prompt asking Claude to walk you through the
     unfilled sections of `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`, writing your answers into the
     file as you go.
   - **Intake finished, Phase 0 not started** — your project's own Section 13
     *Agent Initialization Prompt*, printed verbatim out of your
     `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`. That is the prompt that points the agent at the
     Intake, the Builder's Guide, and your Platform Module, and starts Phase 0.
   - **Work already under way** — a resume prompt carrying your current phase,
     recent commits, and tool-version status.

   The script brackets the message with a `--- Copy everything below this line into Claude Code ---` banner and a matching `--- End ... ---` line; copy what sits between them. **A blank Claude Code screen means it is ready and waiting, not stuck** — nothing happens until you send that first message.

See the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) for detailed walkthrough of each step.

## The Three Modules

Beyond the five-phase build, three modules cover the two situations `init.sh`
alone does not: **a product that has already shipped**, and **a codebase that
already exists**. Each has its own page; this is the "what it is, when you'd
reach for it, how you start it" summary.

| Module | What it is | When you reach for it | Where you run it | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Delta track** | The maintenance and feature lifecycle for a product that has shipped v1.0 — four change classes, per-class gates, a cadence clock, and a release cut | The day after your first release, and every day after that | **Your generated project** — `init.sh` installs it | [docs/delta-track.md](docs/delta-track.md) |
| **Scout** | A read-only survey of any codebase. It writes nothing | Before you decide whether to adopt an existing project | **The framework clone**, pointed at their project | [docs/scout.md](docs/scout.md) |
| **Adoption** | The second way in: bringing an existing codebase under the framework | When the project already exists and `init.sh` would trample it | **The framework clone**, run from inside their project | [docs/adoption.md](docs/adoption.md) |

### The delta track — after v1.0

Phases 0 through 4 end at a tag. The delta track is the loop that starts there.
You say what you need in plain words; it asks **one** question — is this a
feature, a fix, a hotfix, or a security patch? — proposes the answer from your
own wording, and works out the rest from what it can measure.

```bash
cd your-project
bash scripts/delta.sh --open --describe "the CSV export crashes on unicode"
bash scripts/delta.sh --status
bash scripts/delta.sh --close
bash scripts/cut-release.sh
```

**Activation is automatic and gated:** the machinery is installed by `init.sh`,
and `--open` refuses until `current_phase` is exactly **4**. You cannot use the
maintenance loop to avoid building the product properly the first time.

What it gives you: a written brief whose *Done-observable* checklist **is** the
close review; a hotfix lane that ships on the floor alone and collateralises the
speed with a retro that **blocks the next release** until it is filed; a
14-day/95-day cadence clock that refuses a release when a window is overdue **or
unmeasurable**; and a release cut that decides the semver itself, promotes the
changelog, closes the ledger rows, and tags. Policy — thresholds, class gates,
risk surfaces — lives in `.claude/delta-policy.json`, which an upgrade never
overwrites.

### Scout — look before you leap

```bash
cd solo-orchestrator
bash scripts/scout.sh --root /path/to/their-app --markdown
```

Seven sections: what it is built with, how far along it looks, what is already
set up, **secrets across the whole git history** (reported with the rule, file,
commit and fingerprint — never the value), what would collide with the
framework, what the tests do today, and what the setup interview can skip.

It needs nothing installed in the target project and it changes nothing there.
`--run-tests` is the single exception — it runs the project's own test command
once, and it is off unless you ask.

### Adoption — the second way in

```bash
cd /path/to/their-project
bash /path/to/solo-orchestrator/scripts/scout.sh --out ./scan
bash /path/to/solo-orchestrator/scripts/adopt-project.sh --scan-report ./scan/scout-report.json
```

It shows you what the scan found as *evidence*, then asks the one question the
scan cannot answer — whether the project is finished and needs supporting, or
still being built — and lands it accordingly, writing state in a fail-safe order
and committing exactly the files it wrote.

> **⚠ Adoption is half built.** The driver, chooser, reverse intake, state
> writes, adoption stamp and the collision archive (with its disclosure,
> recorded re-adds and pre-staging secret scan) ship and work. **The
> certification pass, the test-debt ledger, the CI carve-out and the Adoption
> Record do not exist yet.** The driver prints a labelled `NOT DONE` block for
> each during the run rather than papering over it. Do not read an adopted
> project as a certified one.
> [docs/adoption.md](docs/adoption.md) lists every gap and what it costs you.

**These three pages live in this repo and are not copied into generated
projects** — `init.sh` ships seven guides into `docs/reference/`, and these are
not among them. Read them here.

## Key Features

- **Phase-gated development** — Five phases (Discovery, Architecture, Construction, Validation, Release) with explicit gate criteria. No skipping ahead.
- **Security by default** — SAST (Semgrep), secret detection (gitleaks), dependency scanning (Snyk), license compliance, and DAST (OWASP ZAP) installed and configured automatically. CI pipeline blocks merges on findings.
- **Test-driven development** — Tests first, implementation second. A tier-keyed commit-time gate hard-blocks a `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` commit that ships implementation with no accompanying test on Sponsored-POC and Production projects (a logged warning on Personal and Private POC), with a recorded attestation escape for integration surfaces that can't carry a unit test.
- **9 languages, extensible to any** — TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, C#, Kotlin, Java, Dart, Swift ship out of the box. Need C++? Drop one CI template at `templates/pipelines/ci/cpp.yml` — it appears as a language option automatically.
- **4 platforms, extensible to any** — Web, desktop, mobile, and MCP server ship out of the box. Need Azure Microservices? Drop a platform module at `docs/platform-modules/azure-microservices.md` and a release pipeline at `templates/pipelines/release/azure-microservices.yml` — it appears as a platform option automatically. **No code changes to the init script.** The framework auto-discovers platforms and languages from the file system. See [Modular Architecture](#modular-architecture) for details.
- **Enterprise governance** — Approval authorities, compliance screening, insurance requirements, backup maintainer, and audit trail. Full documentation suite for CIO/CISO/Legal review.
- **POC modes** — Sponsored and Private POC modes defer governance overhead while you validate the approach with production-quality technical work.
- **One command setup** — `./init.sh` handles everything: tool installation, project scaffolding, CI/CD generation, security tooling, Git initialization, and health check.
- **A lifecycle after v1.0** — the [delta track](docs/delta-track.md) ships into every project: one classified unit of post-release change at a time, a brief whose acceptance checklist is the close review, a hotfix lane whose deferred retro blocks the next release, a maintenance cadence that refuses a release when a window is overdue *or unmeasurable*, and `scripts/cut-release.sh`, which decides the semver from what actually shipped, promotes the changelog, closes the `BUGS.md`/`FEATURES.md` rows, and tags.
- **Look before you install** — [Scout](docs/scout.md) (`scripts/scout.sh`) is a read-only survey of any codebase: stack, phase evidence, reality probes, **full-history secret scanning with the value never printed**, an inventory of what the framework would otherwise overwrite, a tests baseline, and an intake prefill. It writes nothing and needs nothing installed.
- **A second way in for existing code** — [brownfield adoption](docs/adoption.md) (`scripts/adopt-project.sh`) brings a codebase that already exists under the framework, asking one plain-English question and landing it at the phase its own evidence supports. **Half built today** — the certification pass, test-debt ledger, CI carve-out and Adoption Record are designed and not yet implemented; the driver says so, per capability, during the run. The collision archive ships: it copies the files the framework would land on into a timestamped, manifested, restorable directory, discloses every one of them by name, permits recorded re-adds, and refuses to commit an archived file a secret scanner matched.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Git** | Yes | Init script offers to install automatically (brew/apt/dnf). Or install manually: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| **Node.js** | Yes | Floor: 18+ (the init script checks the major version). **Recommended: 20 LTS or 22 LTS** — Node 18 reached end-of-life April 2025, so new installs should pick a supported LTS. Init script offers to install automatically. Required as infrastructure tooling (Snyk CLI, license-checker) regardless of your project language. Also the runtime for JS/TS projects. |
| **Language runtime** | Yes | Python, Rust/Cargo, .NET SDK, JDK, Go, or Flutter (if not using Node.js/TypeScript). Init script offers to install your selected runtime automatically. |
| **jq** | Yes | Init script offers to install automatically (brew/apt/dnf). Required by the Development Guardrails for Claude Code for JSON operations. |
| **Git host CLI** (`gh` or `glab`) | Yes, if using GitHub or GitLab (default host: GitHub) | **Install and authenticate BEFORE running init** — not auto-installed. Interactive runs discover a missing/unauthenticated CLI partway through the run, right before repo creation. `--non-interactive` runs preflight CLI *presence* up front and fail fast — but neither mode ever checks authentication ahead of time, so `gh auth login` / `glab auth login` first regardless of mode. `gh` (GitHub): `brew install gh` (macOS) or [Linux install](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md), then `gh auth login`. `glab` (GitLab): `brew install glab`, then `glab auth login`. **Bitbucket** needs no CLI (just `curl`, which ships by default on macOS/Linux) — export `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN` + `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN_EMAIL` + `BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE` instead (legacy `BITBUCKET_USER`/`BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD` also accepted). `--git-host other` needs neither. Full instructions: [CLI Setup Addendum § Git Host CLIs](docs/cli-setup-addendum.md#git-host-clis). |
| **Docker** | Recommended | Init script offers to install automatically. macOS: choice of Colima (recommended — headless, no license required, auto-starts on boot) or Docker Desktop. Linux: system package with systemd auto-start. Used by Qdrant (persistent semantic memory) and OWASP ZAP (DAST scanning). |
| **Claude Code** | Recommended | Installed by init script. Framework is optimized for Claude Code; other AI coding agents can use the methodology but the CLI Setup Addendum and Phase 2 workflow accelerators are Claude Code-specific. |
| **GPG** | Optional | Used for commit signing. Init's tool plan offers to install it — macOS: `brew install gnupg`; Linux: gnupg/gnupg2 via your package manager (apt/dnf/pacman). |

Init also auto-installs security tooling: Semgrep (SAST), gitleaks (secret detection), Snyk CLI (dependency scanning), Lighthouse (web performance), and OWASP ZAP (DAST, requires Docker).

### Windows Users

**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is required.** The init script, Claude Code, and the development toolchain (Git hooks, bash scripts, Unix CLI tools) require a Linux environment. Native Windows CMD/PowerShell will not work.

```bash
# Install WSL (PowerShell as Administrator)
wsl --install

# After restart, open Ubuntu from the Start menu
# Install Git and jq (needed before init can run):
sudo apt install -y git jq

# If you'll use GitHub or GitLab, install + authenticate the host CLI too
# (not auto-installed — see Prerequisites table above):
#   gh:   https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
#   glab: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases

# Clone and run from within WSL, not from Windows
# The init script will offer to install Node.js and other prerequisites
```

### Linux Users

The init script supports **apt** (Debian, Ubuntu), **dnf** (Fedora, RHEL), and **pacman** (Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS) package managers. Other distributions should install the prerequisite tools manually before running init.

All subsequent commands in this README and the Builder's Guide assume a Unix-like terminal (macOS Terminal, Linux shell, or WSL on Windows).

## What Gets Created

When you run `init.sh`, it creates a project directory with this structure:

> **Note on the tree:** This is the representative layout produced by a fresh init. State files in `.claude/` (`phase-state.json`, `process-state.json`, `build-progress.json`, `tool-usage.json`) mutate as the project progresses. To see your actual current state, `ls -la .claude/` and `ls scripts/` — those are authoritative.

### System-wide installations (with user prompting)

The init script installs these tools globally on your machine. Each installation prompts for confirmation — nothing is installed without your approval.

| Tool | Purpose | Install Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Semgrep** | SAST scanning (static analysis) | brew (macOS) or pip (Linux) |
| **gitleaks** | Secret detection in commits | brew (macOS) or auto-downloaded binary (Linux) |
| **Snyk CLI** | Dependency vulnerability scanning | npm global |
| **Claude Code** | AI coding agent | brew (macOS) or npm global (Linux) |
| **Lighthouse** | Web performance auditing (web projects only) | npm global |
| **OWASP ZAP** | DAST scanning (web projects with Docker only) | Docker image pull |

**Auto-installed external framework (separate MIT repository):**

| Component | Purpose | Install Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Development Guardrails for Claude Code** | Git hook-based guardrails: session-start checks, pre-commit hooks, profile-driven rules. Version pinned in `.claude/manifest.json`. | `init.sh` clones [`kraulerson/claude-dev-framework`](https://github.com/kraulerson/claude-dev-framework) to `~/.claude-dev-framework` (reused across projects), then runs its init to install per-project hooks into `.claude/framework/`. |

**Optional enhancements (user-configured after init):**

| Tool | Purpose | How to Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Superpowers** | Agentic skills plugin for Claude Code (TDD, subagents, debugging) | `claude plugins add superpowers` |
| **Context7 MCP** | Live library documentation for the AI agent | `claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp` |
| **Qdrant MCP** | Persistent semantic memory across sessions | Docker container + MCP server config |

See the [CLI Setup Addendum](docs/cli-setup-addendum.md) or its [Quick Setup](docs/cli-setup-addendum.md#quick-setup--all-recommended-enhancements) section.

### Pipelines

The init script generates **two pipelines** per project. The CI pipeline (`ci.yml`) is selected by your **language** — it handles testing, linting, SAST scanning, dependency auditing, and license checking. The release pipeline (`release.yml`) is selected by your **platform** — it handles building, signing, packaging, and distributing. CI pipelines are working GitHub Actions workflows that run immediately on first push. Release pipelines are templates that require configuration (code signing, deployment secrets, store credentials) before first release.

All framework documents are copied into the project. Each project is self-contained — no external dependencies on this repo after init.

---

## How It Works

### The Documents

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| **[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** | **Start here.** Step-by-step walkthrough from setup to first release. Personal and organizational paths. What you do, when, and why. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **Builder's Guide** | The complete methodology. Phases 0-4, prompts, quality gates, remediation tables, glossary. Reference material — the User Guide tells you when to consult it. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **Project Intake Template** | Structured input. Every decision the AI needs to work autonomously. Fill out using the [Intake Wizard](docs/user-guide.md#using-the-intake-wizard) or directly before Phase 0. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **Platform Modules** | Platform-specific architecture, tooling, testing, distribution. Referenced from the Builder's Guide at integration points. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **CLI Setup Addendum** | Claude Code configuration: Superpowers, Development Guardrails for Claude Code (Git hook guardrails), MCP servers (Context7, Qdrant), CLAUDE.md. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **Security Scan Guide** | Plain-language explanations of the most common Semgrep and Snyk findings. How to determine if a finding is real or a false positive. | Solo Orchestrator |
| **Evaluation Prompts** | 6 adversarial reviewer perspectives (senior engineer, CIO, security, legal, technical user, red team) for project validation. | Solo Orchestrator, Reviewers |
| **Enterprise Governance Framework** | Approval authorities, compliance, risk, portfolio governance. Required for organizational deployments. | CIO, IT Security, Legal |
| **Executive Review** | Business case for CIO evaluation. Can be reviewed independently — including by AI models. | CIO, VP Engineering |

### The Process

**Full path** (Personal projects + Organizational Production):

```
Phase 0: Product Discovery        → Product Manifesto
Phase 1: Architecture & Planning   → Project Bible (+ Threat Model)
Phase 2: Construction (Loom)       → Working codebase + tests + docs
Phase 3: Validation & Security     → Scan results + test evidence
Phase 4: Release & Maintenance     → MVP release + monitoring
```

**POC path** (Sponsored POC + Private POC):

```
Phase 0: Product Discovery        → Product Manifesto
Phase 1: Architecture & Planning   → Project Bible (+ Threat Model)
Phase 2: Construction (Loom)       → Working codebase + tests + docs
Phase 3: Validation & Security     → Scan results + test evidence
Phase 4: Ready to deploy           → No production release (upgrade to full path first)
```

Both paths produce the same quality of technical work — same TDD, same security scanning, same documentation. The difference is that POC projects stop before production deployment. Organizational Production adds governance checkpoints (sponsor approval, IT Security review, ITSM tracking) throughout.

### Upgrade Paths

All upgrade paths preserve existing technical work:

| From | To | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Private POC (personal/light) | Sponsored POC (org/light) | `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-sponsored-poc` |
| Private POC (personal/light) | Production (org/standard+) | `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-production` |
| Sponsored POC (org/light) | Production (org/standard+) | `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-production` |
| Any track | Higher track | `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --track standard` |
| Personal | Organizational | `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --deployment organizational` |

Upgrades add requirements (governance, tooling, validation) — they never remove work. The tool matrix resolver automatically surfaces new tools needed for the higher track.

### Testing & Bug Tracking

The Build Loop includes a configurable test-fix-verify cycle:

1. **Build N features** (interval configurable — default: every 2 features)
2. **UAT testing session** — parallel AI agents (automated, exploratory, cross-platform) test alongside the human developer
3. **Bug triage** — severity classification (SEV-1 through SEV-4), disposition assignment (Fix Now / Defer / Won't Fix / Post-MVP)
4. **Remediation** — agent fixes bugs test-first, re-tests until gate passes
5. **Proceed** — only when all tests pass and all Fix Now bugs are resolved

Mechanical enforcement via `scripts/test-gate.sh` prevents skipping test sessions and blocks Phase 2→3 transition with unresolved SEV-1/2 bugs. Deferred bugs must be resolved or their features removed before validation begins.

Bug tracking is tool-agnostic — configure your preferred tracker (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira, BUGS.md) in the Intake.

Each phase produces artifacts that gate entry into the next phase. The AI executes within constraints. The human validates at decision gates.

### The Workflow

1. **Fill out the Intake** — run `bash scripts/intake-wizard.sh` for a guided walkthrough, or open `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` directly
2. **Start Claude Code** — paste the first message printed by `bash scripts/resume.sh`; it points the agent at the Intake, the Builder's Guide, and your Platform Module
3. **The agent executes each phase** — asking you only for clarifying questions and approval at decision gates
4. **You review at decision gates** — architecture selection, test assertions, security scan results, go-live readiness
5. **Phase 3 validates everything** — five validation scanners (full-tree Semgrep, license compliance with a tier-keyed strong-copyleft deny policy, Snyk, OWASP ZAP DAST, threat-model verification), integration tests, and accessibility audit. The Phase 3→4 gate refuses to advance until every scanner reports pass or carries a signed skip attestation. Zero critical findings before proceeding.
6. **Phase 4 releases** (full path) or **confirms ready to deploy** (POC path)

The [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) walks through each step in detail — what you do, what the agent does, what external approvals are needed (organizational), and what output to expect at each phase.

### Modular Architecture

The framework is built on two independent extensibility axes: **platforms** and **languages**.

**Platform modules** (`docs/platform-modules/`) are documentation — architecture patterns, tooling, testing strategies, and distribution guidance for a specific platform type. The Builder's Guide references them through callout markers (`⟁ PLATFORM MODULE`) at defined integration points. The core guide tells you *when* to do something; the module tells you *how* for your platform.

**Pipeline modules** (`templates/pipelines/`) are executable CI/CD configuration. They split into two dimensions:
- `ci/` — one template per **language** (test, lint, SAST, audit). Copied verbatim.
- `release/` — one template per **platform** (build, sign, package, deploy). Language-specific build commands are injected via placeholder substitution.

This separation means adding support for a new platform requires five components: a platform module (architecture guidance), an evaluation module (reviewer criteria), a release pipeline template (CI/CD), intake suggestions (optional but recommended), and CI template marker updates (language availability). Adding a new language requires one file: a CI template. Nothing in the Builder's Guide, existing modules, or existing templates changes. The web, desktop, mobile, and MCP server modules were each built this way — added independently without modifying the core framework or each other.

**Extensibility example:** To add "Azure Microservices" as a platform, write `docs/platform-modules/azure-microservices.md` (architecture guidance), `evaluation-prompts/Projects/modules/azure-microservices.md` (six-reviewer evaluation criteria), `templates/pipelines/release/azure-microservices.yml` (with `__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens for language injection), and optionally `templates/intake-suggestions/azure-microservices.json` (context-aware suggestions). Then update the `platforms=` marker on line 1 of each relevant CI template in `templates/pipelines/ci/` to include the new platform name. The init script auto-discovers available platforms from the `docs/platform-modules/` and `templates/pipelines/release/` directories and auto-discovers available languages from `templates/pipelines/ci/`. No code changes to the init script are needed — new platforms and languages appear as options automatically. See the [Extending Platforms Guide](docs/extending-platforms.md) for the full process.

## Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Web** (SPA, full-stack, API) | `web.md` | v1.0 — Complete |
| **Desktop** (Windows, macOS, Linux) | `desktop.md` | v1.0 — Complete |
| **Mobile** (iOS, Android) | `mobile.md` | v1.0 — Complete |
| **MCP Server** (Model Context Protocol) | `mcp_server.md` | v1.0 — Complete |

Projects on unsupported platforms can select "other" during init. The Builder's Guide works standalone — you just won't have platform-specific architecture and distribution guidance.

New platform modules can be added without modifying the core framework. See the [Extending Platforms Guide](docs/extending-platforms.md) for the complete step-by-step process — it covers all five components (platform module, evaluation module, release pipeline, intake suggestions, CI template markers) and includes a validation checklist.

---

## Language Support (Current)

The init script auto-discovers available languages from `templates/pipelines/ci/` and generates language-appropriate CI pipelines, `.gitignore` entries, and runtime validation. New languages can be added by dropping a CI template in that directory — no init.sh changes needed.

| Language | CI: Build/Test | CI: Lint | CI: Dependency Audit | CI: License Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npm run build` / `npm test` | `npm run lint` | `npm audit` | `license-checker` |
| **Python** | `pip install` / `pytest` | `ruff check` | `pip-audit` | `pip-licenses` |
| **Rust** | `cargo build` / `cargo test` | `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt` | `cargo audit` | `cargo license` |
| **C#** | `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` | (built into build) | `dotnet list package --vulnerable` | `dotnet-project-licenses` |
| **Kotlin** | `./gradlew build` / `./gradlew test` | `detekt` (plugin) | `dependencyCheckAnalyze` (plugin) | `checkLicense` (plugin) |
| **Java** | `./gradlew build` / `./gradlew test` | `detekt` (plugin) | `dependencyCheckAnalyze` (plugin) | `checkLicense` (plugin) |
| **Go** | `go build` / `go test -race` | `golangci-lint` | `govulncheck` | `go-licenses` |
| **Dart** (Flutter) | `flutter pub get` / `flutter test` | `flutter analyze` | `osv-scanner` (GitHub Action) | `dart_license_checker` |
| **Swift** (iOS native) | `swift build` / `swift test` | SwiftLint | `osv-scanner` (Package.resolved) | `swift-license` |
| **Other** | TODO skeleton | TODO | TODO | TODO |

All CI templates include Semgrep SAST scanning. Languages that require external tools (Rust, Python, Dart) install them explicitly in the pipeline. Kotlin and Java templates include Gradle plugin setup instructions for tools that require project configuration.

The release pipeline is driven by your **platform** selection, not language — the init script injects your language's build commands into the platform template via placeholder substitution.

---

## Project Tracks

| Track | When | What Changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Internal tools, personal utilities, <10 users | Skip market audit. Abbreviated Phase 3. Basic Phase 4. |
| **Standard** | External users, moderate complexity, <$10K/month | All phases. Lightweight market validation. |
| **Full** | Enterprise buyers, sensitive data, >$10K/month | All phases at max depth. Customer interviews. Pen testing mandatory. |

Tracks control scope depth. For organizational deployments, POC modes (Sponsored or Private) control governance requirements independently — a Sponsored POC can be any track. See [The Process](#the-process) above.

## For CIOs and Enterprise Evaluation

The [Executive Review](docs/executive-review.md) is designed to be evaluated independently — including by AI models. The [Enterprise Governance Framework](docs/governance-framework.md) provides the approval authorities, compliance screening, risk management, and portfolio governance required for organizational adoption.

Evaluation prompts are in `evaluation-prompts/`:
- **Framework reviews** (`evaluation-prompts/Framework/`) — 6 independent adversarial reviews of the framework itself: Senior Engineer, CIO, SVP IT Security, Corporate Legal, Technical User, and Red Team. Run after framework updates.
- **Project reviews** (`evaluation-prompts/Projects/`) — 6 independent adversarial reviews of any project built with the framework: same 6 perspectives, with domain-specific modules for web, desktop, mobile, MCP server, API, and framework project types. Run during Phase 3 validation.

---

## Methodology vs. Tooling: What's Portable

The Solo Orchestrator Framework has two distinct layers. Understanding the boundary matters for evaluating vendor risk, planning migrations, and assessing long-term viability.

### The Methodology Layer (Agent-Agnostic, Durable)

These elements work with any sufficiently capable AI coding agent and do not depend on Claude Code:

- **The process:** Five-phase, gate-controlled development (Discovery → Architecture → Construction → Validation → Release)
- **Quality mandates:** Test-driven development, per-feature security audits, threat modeling, documentation requirements
- **Governance controls:** Approval authorities, compliance screening, backup maintainer model, portfolio management, escalation paths, POC modes (Sponsored/Private) for pre-approval validation
- **Document artifacts:** Product Manifesto, Project Bible, ADRs, test results, HANDOFF.md, Approval Log
- **Security tooling:** Semgrep, gitleaks, Snyk, OWASP ZAP, SBOM generation — all agent-independent
- **CI/CD pipelines:** Language-specific CI and platform-specific release pipelines — standard GitHub Actions
- **Templates:** Intake Template, Governance Framework, Platform Modules, pipeline modules

The methodology layer represents the framework's durable value. Phases, gates, TDD discipline, and governance controls are software engineering practices that predate AI coding tools and will outlast any specific one.

### The Tooling Layer (Claude Code-Specific, Replaceable)

These elements are optimized for Claude Code and require retooling to use a different AI agent:

- **CLAUDE.md** → equivalent agent configuration file for the new agent
- **Superpowers plugin** → equivalent agentic skills (subagent dispatch, TDD enforcement, worktrees)
- **Context7 / Qdrant MCP servers** → equivalent context and memory tools (or manual context management)
- **CLI Setup Addendum** → rewrite for new agent's configuration model
- **Init script CLAUDE.md generation** → rewrite template for new agent

The tooling layer is a workflow accelerator, not a dependency. The Build Loop in Phase 2 works without Superpowers — the agent executes sequentially with the Orchestrator directing each step. Superpowers makes it faster; its absence makes it manual, not impossible.

### Current Status: Proof of Concept on a Single Vendor

The Claude Code-specific tooling layer is a deliberate proof-of-concept decision, not an architectural endpoint. The methodology must be validated before the abstraction layer is worth building. Building multi-vendor support before confirming the methodology works would be premature engineering — solving the portability problem before confirming there is a methodology worth porting.

**The planned evolution:**
1. **Current (v1.0):** Validate the methodology on Claude Code. Confirm the phases, gates, TDD discipline, and governance controls produce the intended outcomes.
2. **Next:** Once validated through organizational pilots, retool the automation layer to support multiple AI coding agents. The methodology layer requires no changes — it is already agent-agnostic.

The annual cross-model validation (required for organizational deployments — see SOI-003-GOV, Section IX) serves dual purposes: it validates the exit path from Claude Code *and* prepares the ground for the multi-vendor phase by ensuring Project Bibles remain vendor-neutral technical specifications rather than Claude-specific prompt documents.

### Exit Path

**Estimated retooling per active project:** 2-4 weeks, primarily spent on: rewriting the agent configuration, validating the new agent produces comparable output quality on the existing codebase, and adjusting prompts. The codebase, tests, documentation, and security tooling transfer without modification.

**Risk mitigation:** Periodically verify that the Project Bible produces coherent output when provided to a different AI agent. If the Bible is well-written, the project is recoverable regardless of which agent built it. The Enterprise Governance Framework recommends annual cross-model validation to keep this exit path tested (see SOI-003-GOV, Section IX).

---

## What This Is Not (Today)

The following are outside the current POC scope. The framework's modular architecture can be extended to cover each of these — they are scope boundaries, not architectural limitations.

- **Compliance-regulated systems (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP)** — The governance framework already provides role-based approval gate separation (independent approvers at every organizational phase gate), append-only audit evidence, and anti-self-approval controls. What's missing is compliance-specific modules that map these controls to specific regulatory requirements and a per-change code review enforcement step. This is a content and configuration gap, not a structural redesign. A compliance module is planned that will formalize the mapping between the framework's existing governance controls and specific regulatory standards, add per-change code review enforcement, and provide compliance-specific evidence collection templates.
- **High-availability systems (99.99%+ SLA)** — The framework can build software architectured for HA and produces Phase 4 handoff documentation for operations teams. Application maintenance can continue under the Solo Orchestrator methodology by any qualified person. SLA guarantees are an infrastructure operations responsibility separate from the development methodology.
- **Large-scale distributed systems (microservices, multi-region)** — New platform modules could cover distributed architecture patterns. The extensibility model supports it; the modules haven't been written.
- **Enterprise integration projects (SAP, Salesforce, ERP)** — Specialized domains with their own SDKs and deployment models. Could be addressed through dedicated platform modules and suggestion files.

Today, it's for the projects that sit in the backlog because they don't justify a team: internal tools, departmental applications, prototypes, MVPs, and utilities.

## Should You Use This Framework?

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|---|---|---|
| **Will your project have more than 3 features?** | Continue below | Use Claude Code with a well-written CLAUDE.md |
| **Will it handle user authentication or sensitive data?** | **Use the framework** (Standard or Full track) | Continue below |
| **Will other people use it?** | **Use the framework** (Standard or Light track) | Continue below |
| **Will you maintain it for more than 6 months?** | **Use the framework** (Light track) | Use Claude Code with a CLAUDE.md |

For enterprise/organizational use: always use the framework. The governance artifacts alone justify the overhead. If full approvals aren't available yet, use a POC mode (Sponsored or Private) to validate the framework first — all technical work carries forward when you upgrade to production.

**Minimum skills assumed:**
- Navigate a terminal (cd, ls, running commands)
- Basic Git operations (clone, commit, push, pull, branches)
- Read code well enough to identify obvious problems
- Understand what a test is and how pass/fail works
- Edit JSON and YAML files without breaking their syntax
- Install software from the command line (npm, pip, brew, apt, or equivalent)
- For web projects: understand HTTP status codes and request/response basics

## What This Provides Beyond a Plain Setup

| Capability | CLAUDE.md + Hooks + CI | Solo Orchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| Agent instructions | Single CLAUDE.md file | CLAUDE.md + Builder's Guide + Platform Module — comprehensive AI instruction set |
| Project planning | Ad hoc | Structured Intake Template + phase-gated discovery (Phases 0-1) |
| CI security scanning | Manual pipeline setup | 9 language-specific templates with Semgrep SAST, dependency audit, license checking |
| Release pipeline | Manual pipeline setup | 4 platform-specific templates (web, desktop, mobile, MCP server) |
| Platform guidance | None | Web, Desktop, Mobile, MCP Server modules with architecture patterns, tooling, testing, distribution |
| Enterprise governance | None | Full framework with approval authorities, compliance screening, portfolio governance, and POC modes for pre-approval validation |
| Project intake | Manual CLAUDE.md | Guided intake wizard (interactive script or AI-assisted) with context-aware suggestions per platform |
| Security scan guidance | Read the docs yourself | Plain-language interpretation guide for common Semgrep and Snyk findings |
| Session continuity | Manual context management | Session resume script generates prompt from project state |
| Evaluation tooling | None | 6 reviewer perspectives (senior engineer, CIO, security, legal, technical user, red team) composable against 7 project-type modules (web, desktop, mobile, MCP server, API, CLI, framework); `run-reviews.sh` orchestrates all six in one command |

The methodology, intake template, platform modules, and CI pipeline templates are the primary value. The framework packages operational knowledge that would otherwise need to be discovered project-by-project.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Enforcement has mechanical layers but some gaps remain.** The CI pipeline (SAST, dependency audit, license checking, tests) blocks merges on failure. The Development Guardrails for Claude Code pre-commit hooks (gitleaks, Semgrep) catch issues at commit time locally. **TDD ordering is now a tier-keyed commit-time gate (BL-072): a `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` commit that ships implementation with no accompanying test is a HARD BLOCK on Sponsored-POC / Production projects (keyed on `deployment` + `poc_mode`, not the spoofable `track`) and a logged WARNING on Personal / Private-POC projects — with a recorded `SOLO_TDD_ATTESTED=1` escape hatch for the integration surfaces that cannot carry a fast-lane unit test.** Together these provide mechanical enforcement for security, testing, and code quality. Phase transitions are backstopped too: `scripts/test-gate.sh` blocks Phase 2→3 while SEV-1/2 bugs are open, and `scripts/check-phase-gate.sh` refuses Phase 3→4 until all five validation scanners pass or carry a signed skip attestation (the summary is bound to the tree it validated, so a stale or dirty summary is never silently trusted). Scope control and documentation updates still rely on the AI agent following CLAUDE.md instructions and the human reviewing at decision gates — these remain Tier 3 (guided) controls with no automated backstop yet.
- **Release pipelines require configuration.** CI pipelines work immediately on first push. Release pipelines are templates with TODOs for code signing, deployment secrets, and store credentials that must be configured before first release.
- **Docker is local only.** OWASP ZAP and Qdrant run as local Docker containers (via Colima or Docker Desktop on macOS, system Docker on Linux). Remote Docker hosts and network-accessible containers are not yet supported.
- **Linux package manager support covers apt, dnf, and pacman.** Alpine (apk) and other distributions require manual tool installation. The init script auto-detects brew (macOS), apt (Debian/Ubuntu), dnf (Fedora/RHEL), and pacman (Arch/Manjaro).
- **CI/CD templates ship for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Bitbucket Pipelines.** `init.sh` auto-selects the host-specific tree from `templates/pipelines/ci/<host>/` and `templates/pipelines/release/<host>/` based on `--git-host`. Azure DevOps templates are not yet provided; pick host `other` and supply your own. See `docs/extending-platforms.md` for the contributor guidance on keeping the three host trees in sync.
- **Single language per init.** The init script generates CI for one primary language. Polyglot projects (e.g., TypeScript frontend + Python backend) require manual addition of CI steps for secondary languages.
- **Not yet validated through an organizational pilot.** The framework has been used by the author to build two cross-platform MVP applications (K-PDF, MeshScope), validating Phases 0-2. The pilot evaluation process (Executive Review, Section X) defines how to test it organizationally. Treat this as a methodology with demonstrated personal-project results, not yet organizationally proven.

---

## Current Status

This is the initial release of the Solo Orchestrator Framework. It has been used by the author to build two cross-platform MVP applications (K-PDF and MeshScope), validating the methodology through Phases 0-2 (Discovery, Architecture, Construction). It has not yet been validated through a formal organizational pilot. The framework's own pilot evaluation process (see Executive Review, Section X) defines how to test it organizationally. Feedback from real-world usage will drive future iterations.

**Not Legal or Compliance Advice:** This framework includes references to regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, EU AI Act, and others) for informational purposes. These references do not constitute legal advice and should not be treated as a compliance program. Engage qualified legal counsel in all relevant jurisdictions before deploying applications that handle personal data, operate in regulated industries, or serve users in jurisdictions with specific legal requirements.

**Legal Documents:** Any Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, or other legal documents generated during the framework's build process must be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before deployment. AI-generated legal documents should not be deployed without attorney review.

**External Dependencies:** The init script clones [claude-dev-framework](https://github.com/kraulerson/claude-dev-framework) (MIT License) into the project for Git hook-based guardrails. This dependency's license has been verified as MIT-compatible.
