# tests/test-bl130-attest-fail-guard.sh — BL-130 (Dogfood-2 F-DF2-013):
# `--attest` must REFUSE a scanner whose last REAL verdict is FAIL.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   An attestation covers a scan that COULD NOT RUN (SKIP) — never one that
#   ran and FAILED. The driver already refuses to HONOR a FAIL-masking
#   attestation (BL-113's no-launder carry), but `--attest` still RECORDED it
#   and printed `[OK] Attested skip … recorded` — inviting the operator to
#   believe the FAIL was cleared, and leaving a misleading "attested" row
#   against a failing scanner. The guard refuses at WRITE time, pointing at
#   BL-113's rule: a FAIL must be fixed or re-run, not attested.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES
#   T-attest-on-fail-refused   newest summary says `RESULT <s> FAIL` (an OLDER
#                              summary says PASS — newest-wins is part of the
#                              claim) → --attest exits 2, says REFUSED, and
#                              writes NO attestation into the state file.
#   T-attest-skip-still-works  last verdict SKIP (no PASS/FAIL row) → the
#                              legitimate path still records (rc=0, [OK],
#                              state row present with the reason).
#   T-mutation-fence-excision  `sed '/BL-130-ATTEST-FAIL-GUARD-BEGIN/,/END/d'`
#                              on a mutant COPY → the refusal disappears
#                              (attest-on-FAIL succeeds again) → the guard is
#                              load-bearing, not decorative.
#
# REGISTRATION: no init.sh, not an aggregator → BOTH tests/full-project-test-
# suite.sh AND the tests.yml unit list. Hermetic (mktemp, local paths only).
# bash-3.2 safe. run-phase3-validation.sh is self-contained (no scripts/lib
# sourcing — verified 2026-07-17), so a bare copy is a runnable mutant (the
# bl104 vacuous-mutant trap does not apply, and T-mutation asserts a POSITIVE
# outcome — rc=0 + [OK] — so a crashed mutant cannot vacuously pass).
