#
# BL-222 — the release gate's ONLY security clock is satisfied by a FILENAME,
# and the filename pattern is far wider than the thing it stands for.
#
# scripts/check-maintenance.sh reads the newest dated name in docs/test-results/
# matching `*snyk*`, `*dep*`, `*audit*`, `*semgrep*` or `*sast*`. `*dep*` catches
# `deployment-notes-<date>.md`. WP6 FOLDED the separate 95-day dependency-audit
# row into the deep-security cadence, so ONE stray match now satisfies the WHOLE
# deep-security clock — and that clock is what scripts/cut-release.sh refuses on
# (refusal 3, exit 5).
#
# Reproduced end-to-end by the WP6 adversarial review: a phase-4 project whose
# docs/test-results/ holds nothing but `deployment-notes-<date>.md` reports
# `[OK] Deep security scan (dependency audit folded in) current` and CUTS A
# RELEASE at rc 0 with the tag written, having never run a scan. Delete that one
# file and the same project refuses at rc 2.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES MAKE THIS WORSE THAN ITS SIBLINGS, and both are why it is the
# residual that got fixed rather than merely filed:
#   • it sits on the release gate's ONLY security clock, because the fold means
#     one match satisfies both the dependency and the deep-security windows;
#   • it needs NO INTENT WHATSOEVER. The dated-empty-file residual requires
#     someone to fabricate evidence. This one requires an honest project to
#     write deployment notes.
#
# ── THE THREE RESIDUALS, ALL FIXED HERE ────────────────────────────────────
#   R-WP6-4  SUBSTRING BREADTH — `*dep*` matches `deployment*`. Narrowed to the
#            dependency-audit vocabulary that does not spell `deployment`.
#            Note `*audit*` already covers `dep-audit`/`npm-audit`/`pip-audit`/
#            `cargo-audit`, so `*dep*` was mostly redundant BEFORE it was wrong.
#   R-WP6-7  NON-FILE ARTEFACTS — a freshly dated empty DIRECTORY, or a dangling
#            symlink, satisfied it too: `ls` supplies the name and the date is
#            read off the name. Now the artefact must be a readable regular file.
#   R-WP6-5  CROSS-HOST DATE DIVERGENCE — `2026-13-45` is refused by both
#            parsers, but an in-range impossibility like `2026-02-30`
#            NORMALISES on BSD (to March 2) and is refused by GNU. Same repo,
#            same file, two verdicts depending on the operator's laptop. Fixed
#            by round-tripping the parsed epoch back to a date and requiring it
#            to equal the input, which is host-independent.
#
# And the entry's own trigger: check-maintenance.sh's header claimed all three
# were "Filed as backlog lines". They were not; BL-222 IS that filing. A false
# tracking claim is worse than an untracked residual, because it stops anyone
# looking.
#
# ASSERTIONS ARE EXIT CODES, because the script's own contract is one:
#   0 = every cadence current    1 = something overdue    2 = UNDETERMINED
# and cut-release refuses on 2. A printed label is not the verdict — CLAUDE.md's
# `[WARN]` trap is about exactly that gap, and `## BL-213:` is this script's own
# instance of it.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs, local git only, no network, no init.sh. bash 3.2 safe.
