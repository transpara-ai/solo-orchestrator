# Brownfield adoption WP5b — THE TEST-DEBT LEDGER AND ITS TIER RATCHET.
# Design: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §5.4 (the ledger,
# the two arms, the three honest limits), §5 (kind (c)'s forward equivalent),
# §10-WP5b (the acceptance rows), §3.3 / docs/module-contract.md (this is
# MODULE code: no core file may name it and the boundary lint must stay rc 0).
#
# ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ON ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# EXIT CODES, never printed labels. The `[WARN]`/`[FAIL]` text in this
# framework's gate scripts is cosmetic — check-phase-gate.sh's exit predicate
# is `if [ $issues -eq 0 ]`, so a "WARN" arm that increments `issues` BLOCKS
# and two arms printing identical text can have opposite outcomes. That
# mismatch hid two real scoring inversions in this repo, so printed strings
# appear here only as PATH DISCRIMINATORS: they prove WHICH path produced a
# code, never that a verdict was reached.
#
# ── BLOCKED FOR THE RIGHT REASON ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The ratchet distinguishes its two arms by exit code, the way
# `pre-commit-gate.sh --emit-blocked-gate` distinguishes its two message gates
# (3 = TDD ordering, 4 = Build Loop):
#
#   0  clean, or a tier that does not block
#   2  unusable: no ledger to ratchet against, or not a git repository
#   3  BLOCKED by NON-GROWTH   (the untested set gained a member)
#   4  BLOCKED by TOUCH-REPAYS (a ledgered file was modified without a test)
#
# Every blocking case below asserts 3 or 4, never "non-zero". A touch-repays
# fixture that blocked because the non-growth arm also fired would prove
# nothing about the arm under test.
#
# ── THE TWO NON-BLOCKING OUTCOMES ARE NOT THE SAME OUTCOME ──────────────────
# `light` warns and `no` is silent, and BOTH exit 0. Exit code alone therefore
# cannot tell them apart — nor can it tell either of them from an arm that
# never ran. So every non-blocking case carries a STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATOR:
# `no` asserts ZERO BYTES on stdout and stderr combined, `light` asserts a
# WARN line that NAMES the offending path. "Silent" and "warned" are then
# distinguishable by bytes, not by hope.
#
# ── MUTATION HARNESS STANDARD (all mandatory, all learned in this wave) ─────
#   • anchored end-of-line markers, excised with `s|^.*MARKER$|…|`;
#   • the anchor asserted at sites==1 in its OWN shipped source;
#   • exactly-N-lines-changed asserted (a substitution is 2 diff lines);
#   • EVERY mutant additionally asserts `bash -n` — a mutation that lands
#     mid-continuation produces a mangled parse that reads as "caught";
#   • a MODE-PRESERVING in-place edit;
#   • a FRESH fixture per mutant, from `mktemp -d`, never a counter inside a
#     command substitution (a counter never survives the subshell, so every
#     scenario lands in the same directory — that is how one proof in this
#     wave came to pass against a NEIGHBOURING suite's fixture);
#   • a CONTROL beside every mutant: the same fixture against the UNMUTATED
#     mirror, asserted GREEN in the same run. A mutant killed with no control
#     cannot distinguish "the mutation broke the arm" from "the fixture never
#     worked";
#   • NO BACKSLASH ESCAPES IN A REPLACEMENT STRING. `\n` in the RHS of `s///`
#     is a newline to GNU sed and a literal `n` to BSD sed, so the same mutant
#     would change one line on macOS and two on Linux — and the
#     exactly-N-lines-changed assertion would then be a platform test. Every
#     replacement below is plain text.
#
# ── NO awk IN THE CODE UNDER TEST, DELIBERATELY ─────────────────────────────
# `bash -n` does not syntax-check awk: a dead awk program emits an empty
# result and empty reads as "nothing wrong", so an awk mutant can pass every
# harness check while doing nothing. scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-test-debt.sh
# drives no awk at all — grep, sed and shell only — which removes the failure
# mode rather than defending against it. M8 pins that property, so a later
# edit that introduces an awk pipeline has to argue with a test.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no remote creation, no `--no-verify`.

#
# TWO SED METACHARACTERS IN THE REPLACEMENT, BOTH LEARNED THE HARD WAY IN THIS
# FILE. `|` was the delimiter, so a replacement containing one — `case $status
# in A|M)`, the exact widening a reviewer used to survive a green suite —
# terminated the expression, sed errored, and the mutant was NOT APPLIED. `&` in
# a replacement means THE WHOLE MATCH, so `cmd_a && cmd_b` spliced the original
# line back in twice and produced a mutant nobody had designed. The delimiter is
# now `%` (no marker or replacement in this file contains one) and `&` is
# escaped.
#
# WHICH CHECK CAUGHT WHICH — corrected, because the first version of this
# comment credited the wrong layer and a future author would then trust the
# wrong thing:
#
#   • the DELIMITER defect was caught by the exactly-N-lines-changed assertion.
#     sed exits 1, the file is untouched, `changed_lines=0`. Meta-assertion,
#     working exactly as intended.
#   • the `&`-SPLICE defect was NOT. Measured under the old semantics: the
#     splice yields `changed_lines=2` AND `bash -n` PASSES, so every
#     meta-assertion here stays green. What caught it was M11's FUNCTIONAL
#     assertion — the spliced module dies at runtime (`bad substitution: no
#     closing ')'`), rc 1 and 564 bytes against a wanted rc 0 / 0 bytes.
#
# So the meta-assertions are NOT the defence against `&`-class accidents; the
# CONTROL plus the functional assertion is. Note the generalisation, because it
# is this wave's "bash -n does not syntax-check awk" one step further in:
# **`bash -n` accepts a file bash rejects at runtime.** A parse check is not an
# execution check, and only a mutant that RUNS proves anything.
#
# RESIDUAL, stated rather than left to be discovered: backslash sequences in a
# replacement are the remaining unhandled metacharacter class. `\n` fails LOUD
# (`changed=3`, since GNU sed turns it into a newline), but a `\.`-style escape
# would substitute silently wrong. Nothing enforces their absence — it is header
# convention only. `%` is verified safe today (no call site carries one) and a
# `%`-bearing replacement would fail loud for the same reason `|` did.
