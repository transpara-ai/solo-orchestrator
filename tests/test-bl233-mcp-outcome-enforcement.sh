#
# BL-233 WP-A — the MCP enforcement mechanism must record OUTCOMES, not
# DECLARATIONS. Three shipped files carry the mechanism and, before this suite,
# `scripts/session-mcp-gate.sh` — the hook that actually blocks Write/Edit — was
# executed by NO test in the repository. One suite
# (tests/test-session-test-gate-check-merge.sh) reads `mcp_gate_satisfied` and
# `mcp_requirements`, but it only asserts that the SessionStart hook WRITES those
# fields; it never runs the gate. The test suite had the same defect as the code:
# it verified the declaration was recorded, never that enforcement happened.
#
# ── GROUND TRUTH, measured 2026-08-13 (not from the docs) ───────────────────
# The official Claude Code documentation carries no worked MCP hook example, so
# the payload shape below was captured by registering a probe on both events and
# firing one failing and one succeeding MCP call. Every fixture in this file
# matches it exactly, because `scripts/lint-fixture-envelopes.sh` exists for the
# lesson that a wrong-shaped fixture "silently falls through the hook's `// \"\"`
# fallback and never exercises the detector".
#
#   A FAILED MCP CALL FIRES `PostToolUseFailure`. IT DOES NOT FIRE `PostToolUse`.
#
#   | field          | success (PostToolUse)                  | failure (PostToolUseFailure) |
#   |----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
#   | tool_response  | PRESENT — array of MCP content blocks  | ABSENT                       |
#   | error          | absent                                 | "Error calling tool '…': …"  |
#   | is_interrupt   | —                                      | false                        |
#   | isError        | NONE ANYWHERE — MCP's own isError is not preserved by either event      |
#
# Three consequences this suite is built around:
#   1. THE EVENT IS THE SIGNAL. There is no field to test for success. BL-233's
#      own text says "read .tool_response" — that instruction is WRONG (a
#      successful call's tool_response tells you what came BACK, not that the
#      call worked), and the entry is corrected as part of this package.
#   2. A third state exists: a call rejected BEFORE execution (unknown tool,
#      schema validation) fires NEITHER event. Fail-closed leaves the
#      requirement unsatisfied, which is correct — but it must never look like
#      success. G-group pins that.
#   3. Because tool_response carries the RETURNED TEXT, "succeeded" and
#      "returned something" are separable. Karl's decision 1: a successful but
#      EMPTY retrieval satisfies the requirement, and is reported loudly and
#      recorded. E-group pins both halves.
#
# ── What every assertion here refuses to do ────────────────────────────────
# "A test that passes because a tool was CALLED is this bug, restated in the
# test suite." Not one assertion below greps for a label, a reason string alone,
# or the presence of a call row as proof of satisfaction. Every one asserts on
# the resulting STATE (a JSON field in the ledger) or the resulting DECISION
# (the gate's permissionDecision / the process exit code).
#
# ── Mutation harness standard (all mandatory, per the WP-A brief) ──────────
#   • anchored END-OF-LINE markers, asserted at sites==1 in the SHIPPED source;
#   • exactly-N-lines-changed asserted for every mutant (this is the check that
#     catches a sed that reported success and edited nothing — CLAUDE.md's sed
#     trap; the delimiter here is `%`, absent from every marker and every
#     replacement, and `&` is escaped because in a sed replacement `&` means THE
#     WHOLE MATCH and an unescaped `&&` splices the original line back in);
#   • EVERY mutant asserts `bash -n` — a mutation that lands as a syntax error
#     kills every test for the wrong reason and would score as a pass;
#   • mode-preserving (`stat -c || stat -f`, GNU-first);
#   • a FRESH fixture per mutant — and per DIRECTION. Sharing one project
#     directory between a control run and its mutant run is not merely untidy
#     here, it is wrong: the gate REWRITES mcp_gate_satisfied on every
#     invocation, so a control run that denied left the flag false and the
#     latch mutant (M5) then had nothing to latch onto. It survived, and it
#     survived silently — the meta-assertions were all green because the
#     mutation applied perfectly. Only the direction assertion caught it;
#   • every mutant that changes a project's ledger re-runs its own tracker
#     calls against the fresh fixture rather than inheriting them;
#   • structural discriminators for ABSENCES — an absence cannot be greped for,
#     so the two absence properties (the gate takes NO latch fast path; the
#     tracker re-seed carries NO mcp_requirements) are each pinned by a real
#     line of code whose mutation REINTRODUCES the removed behaviour.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no remote creation, no `--no-verify`,
# no `timeout`/`gtimeout` (absent on the dev host — they yield a spurious 127).
# bash 3.2 compatible: no ${var,,}, no declare -A, no nullglob.
#
# This suite names init.sh on executed lines (C-group reads the scaffolder's
# tool-usage.json seed and hook registration STATICALLY — it never runs it), so
# lint-tests-registered.sh marks it unit-lane-exempt. It is registered in the
# tests.yml unit list anyway: the lint treats a listed test as "the exemption
# decided nothing", and the suite is fast enough for the fast lane.
