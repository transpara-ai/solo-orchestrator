# tests/test-bl172-resume-sentinels.sh — BL-172 resume-sentinel parity.
#
# THE DEFECT (surfaced by the BL-171 fable verifier; pre-existing)
#   tdd_terminal_enforce (the BL-072 tier-keyed TDD-ordering HARD BLOCK at the
#   commit-msg --terminal-mode surface) skipped ONLY on .git/MERGE_HEAD, while
#   its sibling bl006_terminal_enforce honors all three derivative sentinels
#   (MERGE_HEAD / CHERRY_PICK_HEAD / REVERT_HEAD). Net: a strict-tier `git commit`
#   RESUMING a conflicted cherry-pick or revert whose payload is an impl file
#   with no accompanying test was REFUSED by the TDD gate — even though a
#   cherry-pick/revert is a REPLAY of an already-reviewed change, not a
#   TDD-authoring event.
#
# THE FIX (# BL-172-RESUME-SENTINELS): add the CHERRY_PICK_HEAD / REVERT_HEAD
#   sentinels to tdd_terminal_enforce (the refusal gate) matching
#   bl006_terminal_enforce, AND — for parity — to the same BL-072 gate's OTHER
#   entry point, the PreToolUse WARN surface tdd_warn_check (whose in-function
#   comment names tdd_terminal_enforce as its hard-block counterpart; it already
#   passes explicit cherry-pick/revert COMMANDS via a command-string filter and
#   resumed MERGES via the MERGE_HEAD sentinel — the two added sentinels extend
#   that same pass-through to a resumed cherry-pick/revert committed with a plain
#   `git commit`). MERGE_HEAD behavior is untouched; normal impl-only commits
#   (no sentinel) still refuse / still warn (the anti-blunting cases pin this).
#
# CASES
#   Section A — commit-msg terminal-mode REFUSAL gate (tdd_terminal_enforce):
#     (a) CHERRY_PICK_HEAD present + impl-only + strict tier  -> rc=0 PASS  [RED pre-fix]
#     (b) REVERT_HEAD present      + impl-only + strict tier  -> rc=0 PASS  [RED pre-fix]
#     (c) MERGE_HEAD present       + impl-only + strict tier  -> rc=0 PASS  [unchanged]
#     (d) NO sentinel (anti-blunt) + impl-only + strict tier  -> rc=1 REFUSE + [FAIL] BL-072
#     (e) NO sentinel + impl+TEST  + strict tier              -> rc=0 PASS  [normal TDD-satisfied]
#   Section B — PreToolUse WARN surface parity (tdd_warn_check):
#     (f) CHERRY_PICK_HEAD present + `git commit` + impl-only -> NO [WARN]  [RED pre-fix]
#     (g) REVERT_HEAD present      + `git commit` + impl-only -> NO [WARN]  [RED pre-fix]
#     (h) NO sentinel (anti-blunt) + `git commit` + impl-only -> [WARN] fires
#   Section C — MUTATION: excise every `# BL-172-RESUME-SENTINELS` line from a gate
#     COPY -> (a),(b) refuse again + (f) warns again (RED); (d),(h) still block/warn
#     (anti-blunting unaffected); the real gate is the GREEN contrast.
#
# HERMETIC: mktemp fixture repos (git init + local identity + a fake origin
# pointer only — no real remote is ever contacted); GITHUB_BASE_REF unset so CI's
# own env cannot leak into fixture git ops; the sentinel files are created
# directly (a fake 40-hex SHA) rather than via a real cherry-pick/revert, so no
# git subprocess is needed and the gate is driven exactly as the hooks drive it.
# bl006_terminal_enforce / bl006_check no-op here (no scripts/process-checklist.sh
# in the fixture CWD; mothership phase for the WARN fixture) so the TDD gate is
# the SOLE variable under test. No init.sh, not an aggregator -> registered in
# BOTH the aggregator and the tests.yml unit list.
#
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).
