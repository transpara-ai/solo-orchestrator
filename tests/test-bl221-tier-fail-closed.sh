#
# BL-221 — `assert_choosable` fails OPEN on a manifest with no `deployment`
# key, so an adopted organizational project can downgrade its own enforcement.
#
# THE PREDICATE, and why `//` is the whole bug:
#
#   deployment=$(jq -r '.deployment // "personal"' "$manifest")
#   if [ "$deployment" = "personal" ]; then return 0; fi
#
# jq's `//` coerces `null`, `false` AND `empty` to its right-hand side, so an
# ABSENT key and an EXPLICIT null both resolve to `personal` — the CHOOSABLE
# tier. This is the surface that decides whether a project may weaken its own
# enforcement, and it defaults to the permissive answer on missing data.
#
# ITS SIBLING IN THE SAME FILE FAILS CLOSED. `read_enforcement_level` treats a
# missing file, an unreadable one and an unknown value as `strict`. Two readers,
# one library, opposite postures on the same manifest — A8 pins that they now
# agree.
#
# THE DECISIVE CASE IS A3, and it is the entry's case C reproduced: take an
# organizational manifest that correctly REFUSES the downgrade, delete one key,
# change nothing else, and it starts ALLOWING it.
#
# WHY ADOPTION IS THE TRIGGER. The two birth paths write different manifests:
#
#   key                 init.sh        adopt-project.sh
#   deployment          "personal"     ABSENT
#   poc_mode            null           ABSENT
#   enforcement_level   "strict"       ABSENT
#
# and `reconfigure-project.sh` — which calls `validate_transition` ->
# `assert_choosable` — ships into every adopted project. So this is reachable
# from an operator command, not a library curiosity. W1 pins the write half.
#
# BOTH HALVES ARE FIXED HERE, on Karl's decision. Writing the keys closes the
# divergence at its source; defaulting the predicate closed fixes every OTHER
# cause of an absent key — a hand-edited manifest, or the regenerate path that
# `soif_adoption_integrity_lost` exists to detect — and makes the library
# self-consistent. Neither subsumes the other.
#
# EVIDENCE THAT THE WORKAROUND ALREADY EXISTS DOWNSTREAM: `_td_tier_trusted` in
# scripts/lib/adopt/adopt-test-debt.sh already adds its own presence check
# before trusting `assert_choosable`, and its comment says so ("this adds a
# presence check, not a fifth spelling"). A caller defending itself against a
# shared predicate is the predicate's bug, not the caller's.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no init.sh. bash 3.2 safe.
