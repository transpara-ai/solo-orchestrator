# tests/test-bl112-commit-enforcement.sh — BL-112 scaffold-fidelity test.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the fixture-hides-gap class, again)
#   Two "blocking" commit-time gates shipped into every generated project were
#   HOLLOW for months, and every existing test passed the whole time — because
#   no test ever ran a REAL `git commit` through a REAL scaffold's hooks:
#
#   • F9 / # BL-112-SAST-ERROR — the generated .git/hooks/pre-commit invoked
#     `semgrep scan --config=p/owasp-top-ten --quiet` WITHOUT `--error`. Semgrep
#     exits 0 on findings unless --error is passed, so the hook's `[BLOCKED]`
#     branch was unreachable dead code: an `eval(req.query.code)` Express RCE was
#     detected, PRINTED, and committed clean.
#
#   • F8 / # BL-112-STRICT-GATE — the same hook ran an UNCONDITIONAL
#     `exit $FAILED` BEFORE the `# >>> SOIF framework gate (BL-030)` block that
#     install-filesystem-gates.sh appends, so .git/hooks/framework-gate.sh
#     (-> process-checklist.sh --check-commit-ready) NEVER RAN. The
#     phase2-init-verified, UAT-in-progress and build-loop-state gates therefore
#     had NO git-hook backstop — they fired only via the AI-session PreToolUse
#     hook, and any human/script/terminal commit walked straight through.
#
#   Both were found by an end-to-end validation walk, not by the suite. This test
#   is the missing shape: REAL init.sh scaffold -> REAL `git commit` -> assert the
#   commit is REFUSED BY GIT and HEAD did not move.
#
# CASES
#   T-sast-blocks-real-commit      planted eval(req.query.code) -> commit REFUSED
#                                  by git, [BLOCKED] printed, HEAD unmoved.
#                                  (SKIPS LOUDLY if semgrep is absent.)
#   T-sast-clean-commits           a clean source file still commits (no FP) AND
#                                  the SAST arm is proven to have RUN (the hook's
#                                  [OK] receipt). Without that second half the case
#                                  passes VACUOUSLY on a semgrep-less host, where a
#                                  clean file commits precisely because nothing
#                                  scanned it. (SKIPS LOUDLY if semgrep is absent.)
#   T-sast-absent-warns-not-blocks the semgrep-ABSENT contract, pinned at last: with
#                                  semgrep shimmed OFF the PATH of a REAL `git
#                                  commit`, a planted RCE COMMITS and the operator is
#                                  told LOUDLY that SAST did not run. The contract was
#                                  claimed in the PR body with no test behind it —
#                                  which is the same class of lie as a [BLOCKED] that
#                                  never blocks.
#   T-mutation-sast-absent-arm     the other direction: make the absent arm BLOCK ->
#                                  the contract test goes RED -> restore -> GREEN.
#   T-sast-toolfail-warns-not-blocks  semgrep shimmed to exit 2 (broken ruleset /
#                                  unreachable registry) -> DECLARED behaviour: the
#                                  commit LANDS, and the operator sees an unmissable
#                                  "SAST NOT ENFORCED" line plus the real diagnostic.
#                                  This is a security DECISION and it is pinned, not
#                                  asserted (rationale: # BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN).
#   T-mutation-sast-toolfail-arm   the other direction: make the rc>=2 arm BLOCK ->
#                                  the declared behaviour goes RED -> restore -> GREEN.
#   T-strict-gate-blocks-unverified phase2_init.verified=false + real source
#                                  commit -> REFUSED BY GIT (the F8 proof).
#   T-strict-gate-blocks-mid-uat   UAT started, <9 steps, build loop SATISFIED so
#                                  the UAT arm is the only thing that can block ->
#                                  real source commit REFUSED BY GIT.
#   T-clean-commit-still-works     everything satisfied -> real commit SUCCEEDS,
#                                  and a NON-TRACKED .claude/last-gate-pass.txt
#                                  receipt proves the gate actually RAN (not that
#                                  it is missing) — while the TRACKED ledger gains
#                                  NO routine terminal_commit_passed row (BL-161).
#   T-tdd-gate-no-regression       the BL-072 wrong-order (test-less feat:) commit
#                                  is still blocked by the commit-msg hook.
#   T-mutation-sast-error          strip `--error` from the scaffold's hook ->
#                                  T-sast-blocks-real-commit goes RED (the flaw
#                                  commits) -> restore -> GREEN.
#   T-mutation-strict-gate         restore the unconditional `exit $FAILED` (i.e.

# This is a SECURITY DECISION, and it is declared, not assumed: a semgrep that
# FAILS (broken ruleset, unreachable registry, OOM) is treated exactly like a
# semgrep that is ABSENT — WARN, do not block. The full rationale lives on
# `soif_sast_not_enforced` (# BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN) in scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh;
# the short version is that blocking here buys no security (anyone who can break
# the scanner can more easily REMOVE it, and hit the absent arm) while bricking
# every commit of every offline developer, because p/owasp-top-ten is a REGISTRY
# ruleset with no local cache.
#
# What the decision DOES owe the operator is loudness, and that is what this pins:
# the commit lands, but nobody can mistake it for a clean scan, and the real
# diagnostic is on screen.

# BL-161 JUSTIFICATION (contract change BY DESIGN, Karl-approved 2026-07-23/24):
#   The gate no longer appends a routine terminal_commit_passed row to the TRACKED
#   ledger — that receipt left the working tree perpetually one row dirty after the
#   final commit of every session (Dogfood-4 F-DF4-007). The "prove the gate RAN,
#   not merely that nothing blocked" INTENT is preserved, not deleted: the PASS
#   path now drops a NON-TRACKED gate-ran receipt .claude/last-gate-pass.txt
#   (gitignored, mirroring .claude/last-checked-commit.txt). We assert BOTH halves,
#   so the case is still non-vacuous: (1) the receipt EXISTS (the PASS terminal was
#   reached — a commit that skipped the gate would not write it) AND (2) the tracked
#   ledger gained NO terminal_commit_passed row (the dirty-tree regression stays
#   fixed). See tests/test-bl161-ledger-real-events-only.sh for the full contract.
