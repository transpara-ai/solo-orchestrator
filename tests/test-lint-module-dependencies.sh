# Behavior tests for scripts/lint-module-dependencies.sh — the module-dependency
# lint for the BROWNFIELD module set (Scout + the adoption driver), specified by
# docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §3.3 (M1-M5) and transcribed
# as a contract in docs/module-contract.md.
#
# Each case stages a hermetic mini-tree under mktemp -d, points the lint at it
# with --root, and asserts on the EXIT CODE (never on a printed label — the
# repo's [WARN] trap is that labels and exit predicates disagree).
#
# This suite is a SIBLING of tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh and deliberately
# inherits its discipline, including two adversarial-review rounds of lessons it
# paid for. Where the two lints genuinely differ, the difference is MEASURED and
# recorded below rather than copied over — see the X6 note in particular.
#
# WHAT THE SUITE PINS, and which named mutant each row kills
#
#   DIRECTION — M3, `core -> module` forbidden
#     D1  clean tree                                          -> 0
#     D2  core names a literal module dir (T1)                -> 1   kills M-DIR
#     D3  `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/scout/${p}.sh` composition (T2)    -> 1   kills M-T2S
#     D4  `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/adopt/${p}.sh` composition (T2)    -> 1   kills M-T2A
#     D5  core invokes the scout entry script (T1 basename)   -> 1
#     D6  core invokes the adopt entry script (T1 basename)   -> 1
#     D7  `module -> core` is permitted for the DRIVER        -> 0
#     D8  T1 and T2 do not double-report the same line        -> exactly one row
#
#   SURFACE — the four CORE globs, minus module files and BOTH boundary lints
#     S1  init.sh is scanned
#     S2  scripts/hooks/*.sh is scanned
#     S3  scripts/lib/*.sh (non-module members) is scanned
#     S4  the two boundary lints are NOT scanned (self + sibling exclusion)
#     A narrowed surface would pass D1-D8 while seeing nothing; S1-S3 are the
#     anti-vacuity pins for the CORE half specifically.
#
#   M5 — the scanner depends on NOTHING
#     M1  a scout module file sourcing a core lib             -> 1   kills M-M5
#     M2  the scout ENTRY script sourcing a core lib          -> 1
#     M3  an ADOPT module file sourcing a core lib            -> 0
#         (M5 is scout-only; the driver may source core, like the delta module)
#     M4  M5 is not inline-allowlistable                      -> 1
#
#   THE EXECUTED-LINES STRIPPER
#     Same predicate, same scar tissue: CLAUDE.md records that a ONE-CHARACTER
#     narrowing of the sibling predicate in scripts/lint-tests-registered.sh
#     (`# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE`) re-opened the same hole THREE times while
#     passing both PR-blocking checks each time. The pins below name each ATOM
#     of the two sed expressions and pin its WIDTH and its SPELLING, not merely
#     its presence.
#
#     TWO DIRECTIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS CHEAP TO CATCH:
#       • NARROWING (strips too LITTLE) leaves comments looking executed ->
#         FALSE POSITIVES. Any exit-0 fixture catches it. X2/X3/X4/X5/X9 are
#         all of this kind and they are easy.
#       • WIDENING (strips too MUCH) eats executed code -> FALSE NEGATIVES. NO
#         exit-0 fixture can ever see it, because an over-stripped tree is a
#         QUIETER tree. It is caught only by a VIOLATION fixture whose token
#         sits where the widened match would reach. X8 and X10 are those
#         fixtures and they are the load-bearing ones. This suite ships them
#         from day one rather than relearning the lesson.
#
#       E1 = 's/^[[:space:]]*#.*$//'                     (whole-line comments)
#         C1  the `^` anchor          -> pinned by X8, NOT by X7. Dropping `^`
#             blanks nothing: sed's s/// replaces only the MATCHED REGION, so
#             the leftmost match simply starts at the `#` and `x#token`
#             truncates to `x`. A widening — only a violation fixture sees it.
#             (Mutant M-A.)
#         C2  `[[:space:]]*` WIDTH    -> pinned by X2 (0, 1, 4, 8 spaces, tab,
#             tab+spaces). `*` cannot be widened further, so C2's only failure
#             mode is the narrowing X2 catches.
#         C3  `#` SPELLING            -> pinned by X3 (no space after `#`).
#         C4  the WHOLE-EXPRESSION widening (`s/#.*$//`) -> pinned by X8.
#             (Mutant M-B.)
#
#       E2 = 's/\([^[:space:]]\)[[:space:]][[:space:]]*#.*$/\1/'  (trailing)
#         C5  `[[:space:]][[:space:]]*` WIDTH -> pinned in BOTH directions:
#               narrowing to two-or-more false-positives on the single-space
#               form -> X4;
#               widening to zero-or-more makes `x#token` strippable -> X8.
#               (Mutant M-H.)
#         C6  `#` SPELLING            -> pinned by X5.
#         C7  `\([^[:space:]]\)` guard + `\1` back-reference — the executed
#             PREFIX must survive -> pinned at TWO resolutions:
#               X1 (COARSE): a mutation that discards the whole line whenever a
#               trailing comment is present (M-C7C) loses the violation
#               outright. Measured: M-C7C kills X1, X6, M4, L2, L4 and L5.
#               X6 (FINE): dropping the capture (M-C7F) eats exactly ONE
#               character. Measured: kills X6 and nothing else.
#             Both are kept: an edit that eats everything and one that eats a
#             single byte are different mutations and X1 cannot see the latter.
#
#             MEASURED DIFFERENCE FROM THE DELTA SUITE, recorded rather than
#             copied. There, dropping the capture merely DEMOTES a hit from T1
#             to T2, so the exit code cannot see it and X6 must assert the
#             TIER. Here it is rc-VISIBLE instead, because this lint's T2
#             directory tokens are a SUFFIX-SUBSET of its T1 set (`scout/` is a
#             suffix of `scripts/lib/scout/`; the two entry tokens are
#             IDENTICAL in both tiers). Eating the last character of a line
#             that ENDS at a module token therefore breaks T1 and T2 together
#             and the line goes green.
#             X6's FIXTURE QUOTING IS PART OF THE PIN — see the case body. The
#             first draft quoted the path, M-C7F ate the closing `"` instead of
#             the token's slash, and the mutant survived at 39/0.
#         C8  `#` INSIDE a word is not a comment -> pinned by X7 and X8, which
#             cover OPPOSITE failure modes and are deliberately not folded:
#               X7 = the DELETION direction (token BEFORE the `#`; a `grep -v`
#               refactor drops the whole line). X7 does NOT pin over-stripping.
#               X8 = the TRUNCATION direction (token AFTER the `#`).
#
#     X9/X10 pin the SAME stripper on the M5 arm, which is a second, independent
#     call site. A stripper fix applied to one arm and not the other is exactly
#     the kind of half-edit these two catch.
#
#   ALLOWLISTS
#     L1  T2 inline allow WITH a reason is honored             -> 0
#     L2  T2 inline allow with an EMPTY reason                 -> 1
#     L3  the core allowlist's cardinality is exactly ZERO     -> 1 when it grows
#         (mutation M-CARD, executed against a lint COPY)
#     L4  T1 is NOT inline-allowlistable
#     L5  a NEAR-MISS marker (`allowed`, `allowlist`) does not allowlist -> 1
#
#   VACUITY FLOOR
#     V1  no module file present                               -> 2
#     V2  no core file present                                 -> 2
#     V3  mutation M-MAN: empty the MODULE manifest in a lint COPY, run against
#         the REAL repo root                                   -> 2 (not 0)
#     V4  zero-dependency module files present but NO core lib -> 2
#         (the M5 arm's own anti-vacuity clause: an empty forbidden-token set
#         would let M5 pass trivially)
#     V5  mutation M-KNOWN: a typo'd MODULE COLUMN in a lint copy -> 2 (not 0)
#         Added in the pre-PR review round (R-WP0-1) after the reviewer's novel
#         mutant — deleting the `is_known_module` guard — survived all 39 of
#         the original cases. See the case body for why the typo is invisible
#         to both vacuity floors.
#
#   MANIFEST EROSION
#     E1  deleting a manifest ROW does not fully disarm the lint: the T2 token
#         list is an INDEPENDENT literal, so an entry-script reference is still
#         caught. This is the reason the two entry tokens appear in BOTH tiers
#         despite looking redundant — without this case that redundancy is
#         unjustified dead weight.
#
#   INTERFACE
#     I1  --list emits the STATUS table incl. the population INFO row
#     I2  an unknown flag                                      -> 2
#     I3  the REAL tree passes                                 -> 0
#
# HAZARD NOTE — why this file may safely contain module paths.
# The lint's CORE surface is init.sh + scripts/*.sh + scripts/lib/*.sh +
# scripts/hooks/*.sh. tests/ is NOT in it, so the literals below never become
# violations on the real tree. (Contrast tests/test-lint-bl-markers.sh, whose
# fixtures DO land in that lint's surface and must be built by concatenation.)

# delete the `is_known_module` integrity check from the T1-token derivation
# loop — SURVIVED all 39 cases of the original suite. The guard was load-bearing
# and unpinned, which is the one thing this suite is built not to allow.
#
# WHY THE GUARD MATTERS. The manifest's first column is what binds a row to M5:
# ZERO_DEP_MODULES names `scout`, and the zero-dependency population is the set
# of rows whose module column matches. A ONE-CHARACTER typo in that column
# (`scuot|scripts/lib/scout/`) therefore drops every Scout file out of M5's
# population — while the row still contributes its T1 token and still counts
# toward MODULE_PRESENT, so the main vacuity floor is satisfied and nothing
# looks wrong. The M5 anti-vacuity clause cannot catch it either: that clause is
# guarded by `ZERODEP_COUNT >= 1`, and the typo makes the count ZERO, so the
# clause is skipped rather than tripped. The lint would exit 0 with M5 silently
# disarmed — a one-character edit passing every PR-blocking check, which is
# precisely the BL-181 scar class (`# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE`).
#
# Uses V3's copy mechanism so the real lint is never mutated, and asserts the
# copy really was mutated (`typoed`) so a no-op edit cannot be read as a proof —
# the lesson L3 paid for. The control run pins that the same fixture is green
# under the pristine lint, so exit 2 can only be coming from the guard.

# WHY THE TWO ENTRY TOKENS APPEAR IN BOTH TIERS. T1's tokens are DERIVED from
# the manifest, so the manifest and the tokens can never disagree — but that
# also means deleting a row disarms T1 for that path. T2's token list is an
# INDEPENDENT literal, so it still fires. Without this case that duplication is
# unjustified dead weight; with it, the duplication is a measured fail-closed
# property: the cheapest way to silence a violation (drop the manifest row)
# does not silence the lint.
