#
# BL-204 (the "Plus:" item on the entry): host-error jargon — 403 permission,
# rate limits, SSO/SAML org authorization, expired auth — is surfaced RAW to
# exactly the users the framework exists for. Translate the common causes into
# ONE plain sentence + ONE action each, printed ABOVE the raw output, which
# stays below. The precedent is the free-tier-403 block in
# scripts/host-drivers/github.sh (marker `# BL-002`), which this deliberately
# does NOT replace: that block is more specific and still classifies first.
#
# The translator is `host_explain_error` in scripts/lib/host-errors.sh
# (marker `# BL-204-ERROR-TRANSLATE`). Every driver's create/auth/protection
# failure path routes its captured host output through it.
#
# Registered implicitly via tests/host-drivers/run-all.sh's `*.test.sh` glob
# (the same wiring github-free-tier-403.test.sh uses); the aggregator itself
# is registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh.
#
# HERMETIC: no network, no repo creation. `gh`, `glab` and `curl` are stubbed
# on PATH; the only git operations are `git init` + `git remote add` inside a
# mktemp dir.
