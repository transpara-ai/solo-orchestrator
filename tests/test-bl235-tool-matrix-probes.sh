#
# BL-235 — the tool matrix records "Qdrant MCP installed" from a CONFIG ENTRY
# and never asks the database. `check_command` greps `~/.claude.json` for an
# `mcpServers.qdrant` key and `version_command` is `echo 'configured'` — a value
# that cannot be wrong, and therefore carries no information. A project with no
# running database is recorded `already_installed` and reported `[OK]` by every
# surface that consumes the resolver.
#
# ── THE SWEEP, ACROSS ALL FOUR MATRICES ─────────────────────────────────────
# A first draft of this file swept `common.json` ALONE and called that "the
# sweep the entry asked for, RUN". It was one of four. Derive the truth rather
# than trusting this comment — note the `for f in` over the whole directory,
# which is the correction:
#
#   for f in templates/tool-matrix/*.json; do
#     jq -r '.tools | to_entries[]
#            | select((.value.version_command // "") | test("^echo "))
#            | .value.name' "$f"
#   done
#
# On the pre-fix tree that returned ELEVEN rows across TEN distinct tools —
# three in common.json (Qdrant MCP, Context7 MCP, Superpowers) and eight more in
# desktop/mobile/web (dart_license_checker twice, both Apple Developer Program
# rows, the EV Code Signing Certificate, Android Keystore, OWASP ZAP and Android
# Studio). `Android Studio` carried the defect in BOTH fields: its check was
# `[ -d "$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" ] || [ -n "$ANDROID_HOME" ]`, which is true
# of an empty directory and of a stale export — a declaration, not a working
# SDK. D1/D1b/D2 now assert over every matrix file, so the next one cannot hide.
#
# ── THE PREREQUISITE, MEASURED, AND WHY IT COMES FIRST ──────────────────────
# The entry says a probe is unsafe because "the matrix schema does not currently
# express a bound". That is half right, and the half that is wrong changes the
# design:
#
#   scripts/resolve-tools.sh   run_with_deadline "$RESOLVE_TOOLS_EVAL_TIMEOUT"  BOUNDED (10s)
#   scripts/check-versions.sh  eval "$CHECK_CMD"                                UNBOUNDED
#
# Two consumers of the same data, asymmetric bounding — and the unbounded one is
# ALREADY a live hazard: the matrix ships `colima version` as a version command
# (grep it in templates/tool-matrix/common.json), and resolve-tools.sh's own
# header records that daemon-backed commands "can hang indefinitely when the
# daemon is unreachable", which is why IT bounds them.
# (`docker --version` is NOT one of them, and an earlier draft of this comment
# named it as the example. It is client-only — a compiled-in string, no socket —
# measured at 26ms on this host. `docker version`, without the dashes, is the
# one that talks to the daemon. The hazard is real; that example was not.)
# So check-versions.sh could hang today, before this entry adds anything. Adding
# a network probe to the matrix without bounding that consumer would put a third
# hang path into the one script that cannot survive it. T1/T2 pin the bound;
# everything else depends on it. T4 pins its COST, which is a separate question
# from its existence and was answered wrongly once.
#
# ASSERTIONS ARE WALL CLOCK, EXIT CODES AND EMITTED STATE — never the presence
# of a call. A probe that is merely ATTEMPTED is the defect restated.
#
# ── ASSERT THE STATE YOU MEAN, NEVER ITS COMPLEMENT ─────────────────────────
# The first version of D3 asserted `rc -ne 0` where the truth is exactly `2`.
# That passes on `rc=127` — the probe script was never FOUND — and it is why
# nothing here caught the rows becoming CWD-relative. The three-state contract
# the probe header spends ten lines defending had zero coverage. Every state is
# now asserted by equality, and C1 measures the contract where a caller actually
# consumes it rather than where this file can most conveniently reach it.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs, stub binaries on PATH, a loopback-only stub HTTP server,
# no external network, no real database. bash 3.2 safe. No `timeout`/`gtimeout`
# (absent on the dev host).

# character cannot occur in a shell one-liner, so the class is closed rather
# than dodged. `&` is still escaped, because an unescaped one splices the whole
# match back in and that mutant passes `bash -n`.
#
# BACKSLASH-DIGIT IS ESCAPED TOO, AND NOT ESCAPING IT COST A THIRD SILENT
# NO-OP. In a sed REPLACEMENT `\0`…`\9` are BACKREFERENCES, so a mutant
# containing `tr -d '\000-\037\177'` made sed abort with "\1 not defined in the
# RE" — the file unchanged, while `sites=1 parses=1` still reported. The case
# then read "the mutant changed nothing", which is indistinguishable from "the
# guard is not load-bearing": a mutation proof wearing the costume of a passing
# control. `&` has always been escaped here for the same reason.
