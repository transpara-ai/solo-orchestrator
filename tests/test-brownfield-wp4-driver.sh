# Brownfield adoption WP4 — THE DRIVER: its skeleton, the scenario chooser,
# scenario placement, and reverse intake. Design:
# docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §8.1 (the driver, and why
# it is not a mode of init), §4.1 (the chooser, in Karl's exact words), §4.2
# (the scanner OFFERS evidence and does not decide), §4.3/§4.4 (S1 and S2
# landing, and THE FLOOR RULE), §4.5 (what both scenarios share), §8.3 (reverse
# intake), §8.4 (the fail-safe state-creation ORDER), §8.5 (explicit staging
# and the adoption stamp), §5.5 (a run that does not complete must be SAFE),
# §10-WP4.
#
# ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ON ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# EXIT CODES, never printed labels. In check-phase-gate.sh the `[WARN]`/`[FAIL]`
# text is cosmetic — the exit predicate is `if [ $issues -eq 0 ]`, so an
# exemption is the ABSENCE of an `issues` increment and a block is its
# presence. Printed strings appear here only as PATH DISCRIMINATORS: they prove
# WHICH path produced a code, never that a verdict was reached.
#
# ── BLOCKED FOR THE RIGHT REASON ────────────────────────────────────────────
# `pre-commit-gate.sh --emit-blocked-gate` distinguishes its two message gates
# by exit code: 3 is the BL-072 TDD-ordering block and 4 is the BL-006
# Build-Loop message check. T4 asserts 3, not "non-zero" — a post-adoption
# commit that blocked because of the Build-Loop gate would prove nothing about
# the adoption bound this WP's stamp feeds.
#
# ── MUTATION HARNESS STANDARD (all mandatory, all learned in this wave) ─────
#   • anchored end-of-line markers, excised with `s|^.*MARKER$|…|`;
#   • the anchor asserted at sites==1 in its OWN shipped source;
#   • exactly one line changed (a substitution is 2 diff lines);
#   • EVERY mutant additionally asserts `bash -n` — a mutation that lands
#     mid-continuation produces a mangled parse that reads as "caught";
#   • a MODE-PRESERVING in-place edit (a scratch `chmod` silently changed a
#     tracked file's mode twice this wave);
#   • a FRESH fixture per scenario, from `mktemp -d` and never a counter inside
#     a command substitution (a counter never survives the subshell, so every
#     scenario lands in the same directory — that is how one proof came to pass
#     against a NEIGHBOURING suite's fixture);
#   • a STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATOR wherever the expected mutant result is an
#     ABSENCE, because "the arm did not fire" and "the mutant died" share one
#     downstream silence.
#
# ── WHY THE MUTANTS RUN AGAINST A FRAMEWORK MIRROR ──────────────────────────
# The driver is invoked from a framework clone, so a mutation cannot be made in
# a fixture-local copy the way WP3 mutated a gate script it had installed. Each
# mutation therefore copies `scripts/` and the installer into a scratch MIRROR,
# mutates the mirror, and runs the mirror's driver. The tree under test is
# never edited: a failure here cannot leave this repository mutated.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no remote creation. The one thing that
# executes outside the fixture is scripts/scout.sh, which is read-only by
# construction (its own suite hashes a whole tree before and after).
