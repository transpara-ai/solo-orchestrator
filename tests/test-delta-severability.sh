# tests/test-delta-severability.sh — Delta Track §3.1's severability test.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §3.1 ("delete every
# delta-module file and revert the seam block in process-checklist.sh, and the
# full suite must pass — that is the property 'severable' means operationally;
# §11-WP7 makes it a test"), §3.3 (the dependency-direction lint this protects),
# §0.3-C10 (the seam and the single writer are the same file, which is what
# makes the edge cardinality ONE), §11-WP7.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE ENUMERATION IS THE POINT — AND IT IS DONE BY RUNNING, NOT BY REMEMBERING
#
# §3.1 says "the seam block in process-checklist.sh", singular. By the time WP7
# arrived the revert was FOUR core files, and each one arrived in a different
# work package with its own good reason:
#
#   1. scripts/process-checklist.sh   the DELTA-SEAM fence (WP2) — the seam
#                                     itself, and the only allowlisted edge
#   2. scripts/upgrade-project.sh     _postmvp_policy_notice + its call site
#                                     (WP2's §3.2 NOTICE-ONLY arm)
#   3. scripts/validate.sh            _postmvp_era_assertion + its call site
#                                     (WP3's §10.1 report-only assertion)
#   4. scripts/check-maintenance.sh   the cadence policy read (WP6)
#
# ...and TWO more that are not scripts at all:
#
#   5. .github/workflows/lint.yml    the `delta-boundary-lint` job, which runs
#                                    scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh (WP1)
#   6. tests/full-project-test-suite.sh
#                                    `run_child_suite "scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh"`
#                                    — the aggregator invoking the module's
#                                    lint DIRECTLY, not through a tests/ path
#
# CONSUMER 6 IS THE ONE THAT FALSIFIED THIS TEST'S OWN CENTRAL CLAIM. §3.1
# defines severability as "the full suite must pass" after the sever; the file
# that IS the full suite registered a module script directly, the drop pattern
# only ever matched `tests/test-…` paths, and the sweep did not open the file.
# Post-sever that registration is `bash` on a deleted script — rc 127 — so the
# very run the property is stated in terms of went red. V1b and V1c exist for
# it, and m4 rebuilds the old state to prove they fire.
#
# Nobody wrote that list down in one place, and a list written from memory is
# exactly what this test refuses to be. V1/V1b are a COMPLETENESS scan: after
# the declared revert they sweep the severed surface for any surviving mention
# of the module, and a consumer added later without touching the revert manifest
# below makes them go RED and NAMES the file. V1c closes the gap a text sweep
# structurally cannot: a registration whose target the sweep never recognises
# still fails to RESOLVE, and V1c stats every one of them.
#
# THAT CLAIM HAS NOW BEEN FALSIFIED TWICE, BOTH TIMES BY THE SAME SHAPE — a
# consumer living in a file class the sweep did not open (a workflow, then the
# aggregator). Both times the fix was to widen the scope AND add a mutant that
# rebuilds the old blindness, because a scope extension proves nothing until
# something in the new class is shown to trip it. If a third one turns up, the
# lesson is the scope list, not the manifest.
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THAT CLAIM WAS FALSE, AND THE FIFTH CONSUMER IS WHY.
# `_residual_scan` swept `scripts/*.sh` plus the scaffolder and nothing else, so
# the `delta-boundary-lint` job — which already existed — sat outside the sweep
# entirely: V1 reported 0 hits while the severed tree still had CI invoking a
# DELETED file. An adversarial review found it by reading the workflow the sweep
# never opened. The scan now covers `.github/workflows/*.yml`, the sever removes
# the job as a whole block, and V2d parses the result, because a YAML file with
# a job key and no steps is not severable, it is broken.
#
# TWO PROSE-GRADE RESIDUALS ARE NAMED AND NOT CHASED. Neither is an edge:
# nothing executes them, nothing breaks when the module leaves, and sweeping
# them would make this test a documentation linter.
#   • `templates/generated/identifiers.tmpl` carries a `DELTA-` row in a
#     template that documents an ID prefix — a severed project has one unused
#     row in a registry.
#   • `.github/workflows/lint.yml`'s own job-inventory COMMENT names
#     `delta-boundary-lint` while listing what the file contains. V2d measures
#     and reports that survivor explicitly rather than letting a blunt grep
#     count it as a live job; the executable half is what must be zero.
# Recorded so the next reader knows they were seen and weighed, not missed.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE MEASURED FINDING THIS TEST EXISTS TO RECORD (V0)
#
# FUNCTIONAL SEVERABILITY IS ALREADY FREE, AND TEXTUAL SEVERABILITY IS WHAT THE
# REVERT BUYS. Every one of the four consumers fails SOFT when the module is
# absent — by design, and each one says so in its own header: the seam answers
# rc 2 ("the delta module is not installed"), validate.sh's assertion is
# `|| return 0`, upgrade's notice is `|| true`, and check-maintenance.sh's
# policy read falls back to the framework constants. V0 measures that: with the
# module files deleted and NO revert at all, the core probes still behave.
#
# THAT IS WHY THE §11-WP7 MUTATION CANNOT BE A FUNCTIONAL ONE. "Delete a module
# file but NOT the seam revert -> RED" is killed by V1, the structural arm, and
# it has to be — a functional arm would stay green precisely because the
# fail-soft design works. Recorded here rather than discovered later by someone
# wondering why the obvious mutation does nothing.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# "THE FULL SUITE" — WHAT IS ACTUALLY RUN, AND WHY IT IS NOT ALL OF IT
#
# CLAUDE.md: the full suite is ~3h and workflow_dispatch-only. A unit-lane test
# cannot run it, and pretending otherwise would be worse than saying so. V3 runs
# a DECLARED list of fast core suites inside the severed tree, chosen because
# they exercise the files the revert touches, and V2 parses every core script.
# The list is named in the output so a reader can see the scope rather than
# infer it.
#
# TWO THINGS §3.1's INVENTORY DOES NOT NAME, AND THIS TEST DELETES ANYWAY —
# because a module whose own tests stayed behind would leave a suite full of
# red, which is not what "severable" can mean:
#   • tests/test-delta-*.sh and tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh — the module's
#     own suites. RESIDUAL, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: tests/test-delta-wp6-cadence.sh
#     is a delta-track suite that is also the ONLY coverage of a CORE script
#     (scripts/check-maintenance.sh), so severing the module takes that coverage
#     with it. That is a real cost of the module boundary and it belongs on the
#     record, not in a footnote.
#   • their registrations in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh and the tests.yml
#     unit list.
#
# EXIT CODES / TEXT, NEVER LABELS. Every row is asserted on a process exit code
# or on a grep over the severed tree.
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml
# `unit-shard` list. Its executed lines never name the init script — the copy
# step reaches it through a SPLIT token, the same idiom and the same reason as
# tests/test-delta-wp6-cadence.sh::H6 and tests/test-intake-wizard-fixes.sh.

#
#   A LINE-BASED DROP IS WRONG HERE IN TWO WAYS, AND BOTH WERE LIVE. This used
#   to be `_drop_lines … 'tests/test-delta-\|tests/test-lint-delta-boundary'`,
#   and an adversarial review's follow-up hunt found:
#
#     1. A SIXTH CONSUMER the pattern never matched at all —
#        `run_child_suite "scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh"`, the aggregator
#        invoking the module's lint DIRECTLY rather than through a tests/ path.
#        Post-sever that is `bash` on a deleted file: rc 127, and the very
#        full-suite run §3.1 defines severability BY goes red. That falsifies
#        this test's own central claim, which is why it is a fix and not a
#        fast-follow.
#     2. AN ORPHANED CONTINUATION LINE. `run_child_suite` calls span three
#        backslash-continued lines. The head and the third argument named
#        `tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh` and were dropped; the SECOND
#        argument names `scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh` and was not — so a
#        bare dangling string survived, still carrying its trailing backslash.
#        `bash -n` PASSES on it (it is a syntactically valid command), so no
#        parse check could ever have caught it; only reading the surviving
#        references does.
#
#   Same lesson as the YAML job two functions down, arriving from the other
#   direction: a multi-line construct is dropped as a construct or not at all.
#
#   THE PATTERN IS DERIVED from the module manifest, so a module file that is
