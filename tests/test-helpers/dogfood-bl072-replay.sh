# tests/test-helpers/dogfood-bl072-replay.sh — BL-072 Phase C1 measurement.
#
# Karl's standing condition on BL-072: dogfood the TDD-ordering detector in
# WARN mode on this repo (a Full-shaped project whose own history is full of
# legitimate feat/fix/refactor commits) and MEASURE the false-block rate
# BEFORE any hard block (Phase C2) ships. This script produces that
# measurement.
#
# It walks `git log <base> --no-merges` bounded since a cutoff date, classifies
# each commit's OWN changed files with the SAME shared core the live gate uses
# (scripts/lib/tdd-classify.sh), and reports how many feat/fix/refactor commits
# WOULD have been blocked by a naive "impl without a test in the same commit"
# rule.
#
# ⚠️ UPPER BOUND. Per-commit replay classifies each commit on its own files
# only (`git diff-tree`). It CANNOT apply the live gate's "a test written
# earlier on the branch satisfies the commit" allowance, because that allowance
# is a property of the branch history at commit time, not of the merged commit.
# So the replay's would-block COUNT OVERSTATES the live false-block rate: every
# commit whose test landed in a sibling commit on the same PR branch is counted
# as a would-block here but would pass live. Read the number as a ceiling.
#
# Usage (copies scaffold-libs.sh's conventions — resolve own repo root, accept
# optional overrides):
#   tests/test-helpers/dogfood-bl072-replay.sh [since_date] [base_ref] [out_file]
# Defaults: since=2026-04-01  base=main  out=Reports/2026-07-10-bl072-warn-dogfood.md

# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).
