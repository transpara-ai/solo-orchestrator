# tests/test-bl118-sast-dom-xss.sh — BL-118: the SAST gate must SEE browser DOM XSS.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Dogfood-2 finding F-DF2-007, Critical)
#   BL-112 armed the pre-commit SAST gate (--error is passed, the [BLOCKED] arm
#   is reachable, the verdict propagates) — but aimed it at `p/owasp-top-ten`,
#   a ruleset that contains NO browser DOM-sink rules. A real stored DOM XSS
#   (`pane.innerHTML = <attacker-influenced markup>`) was staged on the flagship
#   web/typescript platform; the hook printed
#   `[OK] semgrep: SAST ran on N staged file(s) — no ERROR-severity findings`
#   and the vulnerability reached main. CI shares the blindness (the generated
#   pipelines run `p/owasp-top-ten, p/security-audit`). The gun was loaded by
#   BL-112; it was never pointed at the #1 web vulnerability class.
#
#   The fix adds `r/javascript.browser.security.insecure-document-method`
#   (registry severity=ERROR, so it survives the --severity=ERROR bound) to
#   every emitter of the SAST invocation:
#     • scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh   (# BL-118-DOMXSS-CONFIG) — the single
#       source of truth for the generated .git/hooks/pre-commit
#     • templates/pipelines/ci/{github,gitlab}/*.yml — the generated CI
#     • scripts/verify-install.sh fix_precommit_hook (# BL-118-SINGLE-SOURCE) —
#       which used to REWRITE the hook from an inline pre-BL-099/BL-112 heredoc
#       (blind ruleset, --quiet, no --error => dead [BLOCKED] arm, no managed-
#       region markers), i.e. the repair tool re-installed the exact defects
#       BL-112/BL-118 fixed. It must delegate to the lib, never inline a body.
#
# CASES
#   T-hook-carries-domxss-config     hermetic — the lib-emitted hook's semgrep
#                                    invocation carries the DOM-sink config AND
#                                    still carries p/owasp-top-ten, --severity=ERROR
#                                    and --error (the fix must ADD coverage, not
#                                    trade away BL-112's).
#   T-predicate-no-sigpipe           hermetic — has_live/has_cfg must survive a
#                                    file with megabytes of content AFTER the
#                                    match. The pipe spelling they replaced
#                                    (# BL-183-NO-SIGPIPE) returns 141 there and
#                                    reports a PRESENT string as ABSENT, which is
#                                    how a green macOS run shipped a CI failure
#                                    claiming `p/owasp-top-ten dropped`. This case
#                                    guards the predicates themselves — without it
#                                    every other case here is only as trustworthy
#                                    as the helper it calls.
#   T-ci-templates-carry-domxss-config hermetic — all generated CI pipelines
#                                    (github + gitlab, every language) carry the
#                                    DOM-sink config on their semgrep step.
#   T-verify-install-fix-single-source hermetic — fix_precommit_hook, run inside
#                                    a bare project (no framework source), writes
#                                    a hook that carries the managed-region marker
#                                    and the DOM-sink config: proof it delegates
#                                    to the lib instead of inlining a stale body.
#   T-domxss-blocks-real-commit      live — a REAL `git commit` of
#                                    `pane.innerHTML = userText` through the
#                                    lib-emitted hook is REFUSED BY GIT with

#                                    (LOUD SKIP if semgrep absent / registry down.)
#   T-domxss-clean-still-commits     live — the textContent fix commits clean AND
#                                    the [OK] receipt proves the scan RAN (without
#                                    that, this case passes vacuously on a host
#                                    where nothing scanned). (LOUD SKIP as above.)
#   T-mutation-domxss-config         live — strip the DOM-sink config line from

# `set -uo pipefail` that spelling INVERTS ITS OWN VERDICT: `grep -q` exits the
# instant it matches, closing the read end, so the still-writing `grep -v` takes
# EPIPE/SIGPIPE, and pipefail hands the pipeline that failure — a FOUND result
# reported as NOT FOUND. It is a race on how much the producer has left to write,
# so it hides while a file is small and surfaces when it grows. That is exactly
# what happened: the emitted hook went 645 -> 1,221 lines (41,211 -> 87,956 bytes,
# measured at a8dbef7, the commit CI actually went red on) and CI went red on
# GitHub's Linux runner with `grep: write error: Broken pipe` in the log, while
# every local macOS run stayed green. The failure was maximally misleading — it
# claimed `p/owasp-top-ten dropped`, a security regression, when the config was
# present the whole time. awk with index() gives the same fixed-string,
# comment-stripped semantics in a single process, so there is no pipe to break.
#
# FALSIFIER — restore the pipe spelling and run, from a bash shell:
#   printf 'MATCH_ME\n' > /tmp/e.txt; for i in $(seq 1 200000); do echo "f $i"; done >> /tmp/e.txt
#   bash -c 'set -uo pipefail; grep -v "^[[:space:]]*#" /tmp/e.txt | grep -qF -- MATCH_ME
#            echo "rc=$? PIPESTATUS=${PIPESTATUS[*]}"'
# Measured on this host: `rc=141 PIPESTATUS=141 0` — the match is on line 1 and
# the predicate still reports failure. The awk form below returns rc=0. The
# 1,688,904 bytes (~1.7 MB) that command produces are the PRECONDITION, not
# decoration: they keep the producer writing after the consumer has exited.
# Without them the producer usually finishes first and the bug stays invisible.
