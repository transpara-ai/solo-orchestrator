#
# Regression suite for the PR #105 adversarial-verifier follow-up. Two
# defects the verifier surfaced that the original suite did not catch:
#
#   F1 (atomicity) — scripts/reconfigure-project.sh's
#       data_classification|zdr_attested|zdr_attestation_reason handler
#       claimed to install an INT/TERM/ERR trap and subshell-wrap the
#       mutation block but did neither. A SIGINT arriving between the
#       process-state.json rewrite and the APPROVAL_LOG.md append left
#       process-state.json mutated, the audit row missing, and the
#       snapshot tempdir leaked. F1 mirrors PR #57's `finalize_and_commit`
#       crash-safety contract on the same script.
#
#   F2 (silent jq failure) — scripts/intake-wizard.sh's --data-classification
#       / --zdr-attested non-interactive path AND persist_phase1_artifacts()
#       did `jq ... > tmp && mv tmp pstate` followed by an unconditional
#       success line + exit 0, regardless of whether jq+mv succeeded.
#       Feeding a malformed process-state.json reproduced: jq prints a
#       parse error to stderr, success message prints to stdout, file is
#       unchanged, operator is told the write succeeded.
#
# Both fixtures construct minimal project scaffolds, exercise the
# defective code path, and assert the post-fix invariants.

# F1: Signal mid-mutation in reconfigure-project.sh leaves NO torn state.
#
# Strategy: shim `mv` so that immediately AFTER the mv that commits
# process-state.json into place we send a SIGTERM to the script-bash
# parent. The mv shim then sleeps briefly so the signal has time to
# deliver before mv exits 0 (which would let the script continue to the
# APPROVAL_LOG append). SIGTERM rather than SIGINT because non-
# interactive bash absorbs externally-delivered SIGINT but exits on
# SIGTERM (and SIGTERM is part of the trap contract the PR body claims:
# INT/TERM/ERR). The atomicity defect is signal-class-agnostic.
#
# Verified RED on PR head (44ee984): pstate mutated, APPROVAL_LOG
# unchanged, snapshot dir leaked.
#
# Assertions on GREEN:
#   * process-state.json is byte-identical to the pre-mutation snapshot
#   * APPROVAL_LOG.md is byte-identical to the pre-mutation snapshot
#     (or both files mutated — strict atomicity)
#   * exit code is non-zero
# A torn state (post-fix violation) is pstate mutated AND approval not.
