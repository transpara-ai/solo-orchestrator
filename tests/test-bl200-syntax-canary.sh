# tests/test-bl200-syntax-canary.sh — BL-200's FRAMEWORK-SIDE CANARY.
#
# THE CONTRACT THIS FILE IS. The emitted hook's token-stream-break detector
# (# BL-200-SYNTAX-BREAK in scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh) reads ONE line of
# semgrep --verbose output: `[WARN] Syntax error at line <target>:N` at column
# 0. That anchor is REPORT-DEPENDENT — semgrep may respell it in any release —
# and the detector's admissibility terms (BL-200, constrained by BL-192's
# decision blocks) accept that ONLY because drift degrades to under-detection
# (the pre-BL-200 status quo), never to a false receipt, AND because this file
# exists: it scans committed-in-substance fixtures with the HOST semgrep and
# asserts the spelling still fires, so an upstream respelling turns THIS
# repo's CI lane red instead of silently blinding every generated project
# (BL-193: spellings move between versions and even between streams).
#
# NETWORK-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION. The probe ruleset is local, and its pattern
# names `innerHTML` deliberately: semgrep only PARSES a file some rule's
# literal prefilter admits (measured — a nonsense-token probe rule scanned the
# broken fixture and NO warning ever existed), so the probe must share a
# literal with the fixture. That is also why the detector works at all: a file
# hiding a sink textually CONTAINS the sink, so the parse is always attempted
# on exactly the files that matter.
#
# CASES
#   C1-broken-warns        the break fixture yields >=1 exact-spelling warning
#                          line — THE canary assertion.
#   C2-broken-still-blind  rc stays 0 with 0 findings on sink+break — the
#                          blind spot is still the landscape. If THIS moves,
#                          semgrep started failing loud on syntax breaks and
#                          BL-200's whole design deserves re-evaluation.
#   C3-clean-control       a VALID file admitted by the same prefilter warns 0
#                          times and rc=1 (the probe matches its innerHTML) —
#                          proves the parse genuinely ran; without this, C1
#                          could pass on a semgrep that warns about everything
#                          and C2 on one that scans nothing.
#   C4-header-once         the Scan Status header prints exactly once under
#                          --verbose on both fixtures — the emitted hook's
#                          exactly-once parse (# BL-112-SCAN-COVERAGE) rides
#                          on this staying true when the flag is on.
#
# REGISTRATION: never runs init.sh, not an aggregator -> registered in BOTH
# tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND the tests.yml unit fast lane, PINNED to
# the sast shard (the whole point is the CI host's real semgrep).
# Hermetic: mktemp workdir, no git, no network. bash-3.2 safe.
