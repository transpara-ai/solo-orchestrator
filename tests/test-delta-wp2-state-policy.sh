# tests/test-delta-wp2-state-policy.sh — Delta Track WP2.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §7.1 (the delta-state schema +
# the D7 single-writer rule), §7.2 (the project-owned delta-policy schema),
# §3.2 (the mechanism/policy split — NOTICE-ONLY is the DECIDED sync semantics,
# modelled on the `# BL-099-DOC-GUARD` rendered-doc fence), §3.1 (the ONE seam),
# §11-WP2 (test intent + the design's own mutation).
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh,
# whose first pass resolves every marker to a `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc
# path above is the citation, per the WP1 precedent.)
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, AND WHICH MUTANT EACH ROW KILLS
#
# Every row below was verified by EXECUTING its mutant and watching the named
# case go RED, then restoring and watching it go GREEN. A pin whose fixture
# never reaches the guarded code is the defect class both prior WPs in this
# build were caught on, so the mutants are not described — they are RUN, here,
# in cases M1/M1b/M2/M3/M4/M5. A green suite is the proof.
#
#   STATE (§7.1)
#     S1  read with no state file            -> the §7.1 empty document, rc 0
#     S2  write-then-read round trip through the seam
#     S3a ATOMICITY, through the production surface: an update whose result
#         violates the schema shape leaves the previous file BYTE-IDENTICAL and
#         drops no `.tmp` residue.                       KILLS M2
#     S3b ATOMICITY, at the lib boundary: invalid JSON on the write's stdin
#         leaves the previous file BYTE-IDENTICAL.       KILLS M2
#     S4  corrupt state file -> defaults on stdout, warning on stderr, rc 0
#     S4b valid JSON of the WRONG SHAPE -> same, AND still writable (the guard
#         must not lock the single writer out of its own file)
#     S5  `closed` is append-only: an update that DROPS a closed row is refused
#         and writes nothing
#     S5b the REWRITE half of append-only — reorder, equal-length replacement,
#         in-place field rewrite, and the bare shipped_in fill
#     S6  single writer (D7): the boundary lint passes on the real tree and its
#         seam allowlist is still cardinality ONE, so no core file other than
#         scripts/process-checklist.sh can name the state file. Cited, not
#         re-implemented — scripts/lint-delta-boundary.sh owns that predicate
#         and tests/test-lint-delta-boundary.sh owns its mutations.
#     S7  malformed candidates refused when a state file already exists
#     S7b the same list on a FIRST-EVER write — the per-atom pin for every
#         SHAPE-ATOM-*, because there the shape predicate is the ONLY refuser
#
#   THE shipped_in WRITE-ONCE PATHWAY (§7.1 Part 2)
#     SH1 the cut-time backfill succeeds and changes nothing else
#     SH2 write-once: a second ship, an unknown id, a missing argument
#     SH3 every OTHER closed[] mutation is refused by the ship predicate too
#     SH4 an unrecognised closed-rule fails CLOSED; ship with no previous file
#         is refused
#
#   ── WHY S5b / S7 / SH3 EXIST, AND THE RULE THEY ENCODE ──────────────────
#   The first cut of this suite pinned only the DROP half of append-only and
#   none of the shape atoms. An adversarial review (R-WP2-1) then deleted three
#   atoms of the shipped write guard — the prefix-equality atom, the
#   closed-is-array atom, and the schemaVersion atom — and the suite stayed at
#   24/0 with all 14 lints green. That is the repo's own recorded defect class
#   (CLAUDE.md / `# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE`: a one-character narrowing
#   passed both PR-blocking checks three times).
#
#   THE RULE, now enforced by construction: EVERY atom of the write guard
#   carries a marker, and every marker has at least one refusal case behind it.
#   The per-atom counterfactual sweep (neuter one marked atom -> the suite must
#   go RED) is the audit. The guard currently has SIXTEEN atoms:
#     7 shape   SCHEMAVERSION ACTIVE RETROS CADENCE CLOSED CLOSED-ROWS
#               NO-EXTRA-KEYS
#     1 append  PREFIX
#     8 ship    ROW-IDENTITY WRITE-ONCE STRING-TYPE STRING-NONEMPTY OUTSIDE
#               LENGTH NO-BAD EXACTLY-ONE
#
#   HOW TO RUN THE SWEEP, AND THE ONE WAY IT LIES. Neuter a marked line to
#   `and (true)` and re-run. ANCHOR THE MARKER MATCH — `/# SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED$/`,
#   never a bare `/SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED/`. An unanchored address also matches
#   SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED-ROWS, so it neuters TWO atoms at once and credits the
#   resulting RED to the wrong one. That is not hypothetical: it is exactly how
#   the first sweep on this branch reported SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED as pinned when it
#   was not, and an adversarial re-review caught it. A sweep tool that
#   over-matches produces false GREEN pins, which is worse than no sweep.
#
#   FOUR HOLES THE SWEEP HAS FOUND SO FAR, none of them visible by reading:
#     • SHIP-ATOM-OUTSIDE — unpinned. The "change outside closed" case had no
#       accompanying fill, so EXACTLY-ONE refused it first and OUTSIDE never had
#       to do any work. SH3 now carries a fill+outside candidate.
#     • SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED — unpinned, MASKED by the seeded fixture (the append
#       guard refused the probe before the shape atom ran). Under the neuter a
#       first-ever write of `closed: "not-an-array"` was ACCEPTED through the
#       production seam. S7b is the unmasked pin.
#     • APPEND-ATOM-LENGTH — UNPINNABLE, not merely unpinned: prefix-equality
#       subsumes it. DELETED rather than papered over.
#     • SHAPE-ATOM-OBJECT — likewise unpinnable: every non-object candidate is
#       already refused by the atoms that index the document. DELETED. See the
#       notes in scripts/lib/delta-state.sh for both deletions.
#
#   The two categories are different and the remedy differs: an unpinned atom
#   needs a fixture where it is the ONLY possible refuser; an unpinnable atom
#   needs deleting, because no such fixture can exist.
#
#   POLICY (§7.2)
#     P1  the seed writer emits the §7.2 defaults, key for key
#     P2  a SECOND seed does not overwrite an existing file  KILLS M4
#     P3  absent KEY (file present) -> framework default; a present sibling key
#         still wins                                        KILLS M3
#     P4  absent FILE -> every key resolves to its default
#     P5  corrupt file -> defaults, warning on stderr, rc 0 for reads
#     P6  a key in neither the project file nor the defaults -> rc 1, no output
#
#   NOTICE-ONLY (§3.2)
#     N1  the `# BL-099-DOC-GUARD` flag matrix, mirrored: under a bare sync,
#         --dry-run, and --apply-doc-updates {sidecar|overwrite|overwrite
#         --confirm-doc-overwrite}, `.claude/delta-policy.json` is byte-identical
#         AND the `.claude/delta-policy*` NAMESPACE does not grow (no `.new`, no
#         `.bak`, no template copy) AND the notice names the missing key.
#                                                    KILLS M1 and M1b
#     N2  a project with NO policy file gets NO notice and NO file
#     N3  a COMPLETE policy file gets no notice at all
#     N4  ROUTING: the notice text is produced by the seam
#         (process-checklist.sh --delta-policy-notice), and upgrade-project.sh
#         reaches it core->core. The boundary lint stays rc=0 with the seam
#         allowlist at cardinality 1.
#     M5  the single inline T2 waiver on upgrade-project.sh's seam invocation is
#         LOAD-BEARING: strip its `# lint-delta-boundary: allow` marker and the
#         boundary lint goes rc=1. This is the pin on the lint-forced routing —
#         it proves the invocation is a real T2 hit being consciously waived
#         with a reason, not a line the lint cannot see.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EXIT CODES, NOT LABELS. Every assertion below reads an exit code, a file's
# bytes (md5), or a directory listing. None reads a printed [OK]/[WARN] banner —
# CLAUDE.md's [WARN] trap is that the label and the exit predicate disagree.
#
# HERMETICITY: every fixture is a mktemp -d project that carries NO init.sh and
# NO templates/generated, so `guard_not_in_framework` sees a project and not the
# framework. Sync runs pin CDF_HOME to a nonexistent path (BL-001 skips
# gracefully — no clone, no network), configure a git identity, unset
# GITHUB_BASE_REF, and feed </dev/null + SOIF_NONINTERACTIVE=1. No remote is
# ever created. bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml
# `unit-shard` list. It never EXECUTES init.sh — the mutant-framework builder
# copies it as a file because scaffold-shipped-set.sh reads it to derive the
# shipped set, exactly as tests/test-upgrade-sync-framework.sh does.

# ── S7 / S7b: the shape atoms, one refusal each ────────────────────────────
# ONE candidate list, run under TWO fixtures, and only the second is the pin.
#
# S7  (seeded)  a state file already exists — the realistic case.
# S7b (fresh)   NO state file exists, so this is a FIRST-EVER write.
#
# WHY BOTH, AND WHY THE FRESH ONE IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF. The seeded fixture
# MASKS the shape atoms: with a previous file present the append guard runs too,
# and it refuses most of these candidates incidentally (a string prefix-sliced
# against the old rows array is never equal to it). So a seeded refusal proves
# the CANDIDATE is refused, not that the SHAPE ATOM refused it — and an
# adversarial re-review used exactly that gap to delete SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED with
# the suite still at 30/0, then demonstrated the real hole: under the neuter, a
# first-ever write of `closed: "not-an-array"` through the production seam was
# ACCEPTED and landed on disk.
#
# On a fresh project there is no previous file, so the append guard never runs
# and the shape predicate is the ONLY thing that can refuse. Each candidate
# below is then refused by exactly one atom, which is what makes S7b a per-atom
# pin instead of a per-candidate one.
#
# THIS IS THE SECOND TIME MASKING HAS HIDDEN A DEAD ATOM ON THIS BRANCH
# (SHIP-ATOM-OUTSIDE was the first). The rule it teaches: when a case is meant
# to pin atom X, put the fixture in the state where X is the only possible
# refuser — otherwise the case pins whichever guard happens to fire first.
