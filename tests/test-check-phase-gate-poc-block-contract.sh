# BL-063: tighten the Phase-3→4 POC-block enforcement-point contracts from
# "the documented POC-block message is PRESENT" to "the POC block fires for
# the right reason, ALONE".
#
# THE DEFECT (from the 2026-06-29 adversarial certainty re-walk, S-6):
#   The scenarios `edge-phase-3-to-4-poc-blocked-check-phase-gate` and
#   `…-process-checklist` asserted only that the POC-block string appeared
#   somewhere in the output. In one recorded run the gate emitted 15
#   inconsistencies and the POC line was merely one of them — so a future
#   regression that adds an UNRELATED failure at the same enforcement point
#   would slip through unnoticed (the POC line is still present, the loose
#   assertion still fires). This file replaces "message-present" with a
#   count-based "the POC block is the only sanctioned failure line" contract.
#
# TWO ENFORCEMENT POINTS, TWO MARKERS, TWO CASES (verified 2026-07-09):
#   • scripts/check-phase-gate.sh (:1381) emits a GitHub annotation
#       ::error::Phase 4 (production release) is BLOCKED — …   (uppercase BLOCKED)
#     It does NOT short-circuit — the gate keeps evaluating every other
#     section — so a co-firing `[FAIL]`/`::error::` is buildable and the
#     tightened contract is a count: exactly one sanctioned `::error::`
#     (the POC line) and ZERO other `::error::`/`[FAIL]` lines.
#   • scripts/process-checklist.sh::start_phase4() (:578) emits
#       [FAIL] Phase 4 (production release) is blocked — …    (lowercase blocked)
#     via print_fail, then `exit 1` IMMEDIATELY (:581). A co-firing count is
#     unbuildable there, so the tightened contract is the short-circuit
#     itself: rc=1, exactly ONE `[FAIL]`, and no later-step output.
#   The two sites differ in BOTH marker (::error:: vs [FAIL]) and case
#   (BLOCKED vs blocked); the per-site assertions below are case-sensitive
#   and site-specific — one shared pattern cannot serve both.
#
# BL-082-PROOFING (parallel PR WP-A / BL-082 adds tree-hash staleness to the
#   Phase-3 validation-summary trust path): that logic lives ENTIRELY inside
#   the `current_phase >= 4` BL-070 block (check-phase-gate.sh:1300) and the
#   summary-discovery it guards. This fixture is pinned at EXACTLY phase 3 —
#   which is all the POC block needs (`current_phase >= 3`, :1373) — so the
#   phase-4 BL-070/summary/staleness machinery never runs and BL-082 cannot
#   perturb this fixture. No git repo, no summary file, no tree hash is
#   required. That is the deliberate BL-082-proofing.
#
# NO ALLOWLIST NEEDED: the fixture is constructed so every OTHER gate section
#   genuinely passes (see build_poc_fixture below) — there is no legitimately
#   co-firing failure line, so the "unexpected failure" allowlist is empty.
#   Each artifact/state below exists specifically to keep a gate section on
#   its [OK]/[INFO]/[WARN] path and off its [FAIL] path. ([WARN] lines are
#   expected and legitimate for a POC that stops at Phase 3 — they are NOT
#   failures and are intentionally excluded from the contract count.)
#
# Hermetic: mktemp fixtures only; no git init, no remotes, no gh/glab/curl.

# ── Fixture: a Phase-3 POC project where every gate section OTHER than the
# POC block genuinely passes. Each line is load-bearing for exactly that:
#   • current_phase=3            → POC block fires (>=3); phase-4 BL-070 block
#                                  (>=4) and its summary/BL-082 path stay off.
#   • deployment=personal        → all organizational-only [FAIL] paths
#                                  (self-approval, dual-approval, pre-cond) skip.
#   • track=light                → Full-track pen-test [FAIL] + enforced
#                                  review-gate [FAIL] both skip (WARN at most).
#   • gates{} dates + APPROVAL_LOG dated headers → gate-date checks take the
#                                  idempotent [INFO] path, not a WARN/FAIL.
#   • process-state data_classification=public → Phase 1→2 ZDR gate is [OK]
#                                  (public data needs no ZDR attestation).
#   • NO .claude/manifest.json   → Phase 1→2 protection backstop + BL-084 push
#                                  gate both skip (they require a manifest);
#                                  this is what keeps sponsored_poc clean too.
#   • PROJECT_BIBLE.md present    → avoids the "PROJECT_BIBLE.md not found" FAIL.
#   • docs/test-results/ non-empty→ avoids the empty/missing-dir FAIL.
#   • BUGS.md (no open bugs) + FEATURES.md → the Phase-3 bug gate resolves to
#                                  "clear" with no open SEV-1/2, so its
#                                  print_fail lines never fire.
