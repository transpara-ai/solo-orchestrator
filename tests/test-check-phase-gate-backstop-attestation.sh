# Regression test for code-check-gates-1 (BL-002 follow-up).
#
# Bug: scripts/check-phase-gate.sh's Phase 1→2 BACKSTOP block (lines
# ~279-305) unconditionally invoked `host_verify_protection "main" "$mode"`
# whenever current_phase >= 2, without first consulting
# `.claude/process-state.json::phase2_init.attestations.branch_protection.reason`.
#
# When a project legitimately attested `github_free_tier` at init (because
# branch protection is not available on free-tier private repos), the
# backstop would still call gh api and surface
#   [FAIL] Phase 1→2 backstop: protection verification failed
# even though `scripts/check-gate.sh --preflight` PASSED at the same
# moment. Operator gets contradictory signals; the FAIL is a
# silent-bypass-shaped false-fail affecting the BL-002 demographic.
#
# Fix: mirror the pattern shipped at scripts/check-gate.sh::cmd_preflight
# lines 52-64 — read the attestation reason; on `github_free_tier`, print
# an [OK] line and SKIP the host_verify_protection call (do not increment
# $issues).
#
# Test pattern blueprint: tests/test-check-gate.sh::T5
# (t5_preflight_honors_free_tier_attestation).

# T4 (positive — BL-032 backstop analog): mirrors T1 for the new
# `gitlab_free_tier_approvals` attestation reason introduced by PR #134.
# The Phase 1→2 backstop in scripts/check-phase-gate.sh acquired an
# `elif` branch at ~line 678-683 that emits an OK line and short-circuits
# host_verify_protection when the reason equals gitlab_free_tier_approvals
# (gitlab.com Free-tier org-mode projects — approvals PUT is Premium-only,
# so the attestation IS the gate). This test proves that branch fires:
#   1. Preseed process-state.json with reason = gitlab_free_tier_approvals.
#   2. Run check-phase-gate.sh under the same PATH-stubbed setup as T1
#      (gh stub returns 403 on protection GET — proves the elif skipped
#      host driver dispatch, because otherwise the stub 403 would surface
#      as a backstop FAIL).
#   3. Assert rc=0 AND the specific gitlab_free_tier_approvals OK line is
#      emitted (not merely "attested" — the branch-specific message must
#      appear so we know it was THIS elif, not the github_free_tier if
#      or a fallthrough).
#
# Mutation-proven: replacing the elif body at check-phase-gate.sh:678-683
# with `false  # deliberately break` makes this test fail RED (rc != 0
# because `set -euo pipefail` propagates the `false`).
