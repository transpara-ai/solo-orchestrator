#
# BL-229 — the release/CI pipeline paths were HARDCODED to the GitHub spelling
# in five places, so on GitLab and Bitbucket the checks that read them either
# said nothing or said something false. One root cause, three distinct symptoms:
#
#   1. scripts/check-phase-gate.sh  — `[ -f ".github/workflows/release.yml" ]`
#      is false on the other two hosts, so the Phase 3→4 release-TODO block is
#      SKIPPED ENTIRELY and prints nothing. A pipeline full of unconfigured
#      TODOs passes the gate. Not a wrong answer — a MISSING one that reads
#      exactly like a clean one.
#   2. scripts/validate.sh          — the same paths, but with `fail`, and
#      `fail` increments `errors` while the script ends `exit $errors`. So a
#      HEALTHY GitLab or Bitbucket project is told
#      `[FAIL] CI pipeline missing (.github/workflows/ci.yml)` and exits
#      one higher than the identical GitHub project. A FALSE FAILURE, visible
#      to the operator, on a project that is correct.
#   3. scripts/verify-install.sh / scripts/reconfigure-project.sh — the writers.
#      verify-install refused to auto-fix gitlab/bitbucket on the stated grounds
#      that "there is no separate release file at repo root", which contradicts
#      init.sh (it writes one) and is only half true (see below).
#
# ── AND THE ONE UNDERNEATH (why fixing the readers alone would be theatre) ──
# init.sh wrote `.gitlab-ci/release.yml` and `.bitbucket/release-pipelines.yml`
# and NOTHING INCLUDED EITHER. A comment at the writer claimed "deploy phase is
# appended to bitbucket-pipelines.yml via include"; no such include existed
# anywhere in the repo. So on two of three hosts the scaffolded release pipeline
# was written to disk and never executed, and the Phase 3→4 gate would have been
# carefully validating a file that could not run.
#
# The two hosts are NOT symmetric, and the asymmetry is the design:
#   • GitLab    — `include: local` genuinely supports a subdirectory file, so
#                 `.gitlab-ci/release.yml` is legitimate and merely needed
#                 wiring. Fixed by emitting the include.
#   • Bitbucket — sharing is CROSS-REPOSITORY only
#                 (`definitions.imports.<name>: <repo-slug>:<ref>:<path>`, and
#                 the source file needs `export: true` in the OTHER repo).
#                 There is no same-repo local include, so a separate release
#                 file can NEVER execute. Karl's decision: fold the release
#                 steps into `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` and stop writing the dead
#                 file. `verify-install.sh` was right about Bitbucket and wrong
#                 about GitLab; both halves are corrected.
#
# THE RESOLVER IS THE POINT. `scripts/lib/host.sh` now owns the mapping ONCE
# (`# BL-229-HOST-PIPELINE-PATHS`) and every caller asks it. init.sh's own
# `case "$host"` is replaced by a call, so the sync-sibling trap that
# `# BL-084-TIER-KEY` exists for is not re-created here. host.sh is already
# shipped downstream by init.sh's copy list and already sourced by
# check-phase-gate.sh, so every consumer can reach it in a generated project.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no init.sh invocation. bash 3.2 safe.
