# tests/test-upgrade-sync-framework.sh — BL-099 SLICE-A regression suite.
#
# Covers scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework (same-tier refresh of the
# vendored gate scripts / helper libs / hooks / framework docs from the FRAMEWORK
# copy being run) and its --dry-run / --install-hooks / --apply-doc-updates /
# --confirm-doc-overwrite modifiers.
#
# CONSENT IS DRIVEN BY FLAGS, NOT BY A TTY (review round 1). Every run here is
# non-interactive, so the doc-apply consent path is exercised through the DECLARED
# CLI flags — --apply-doc-updates <skip|sidecar|overwrite> chooses the action and
# --confirm-doc-overwrite answers the destructive second consent — exactly the
# channel real scripted operators use. That is what lets T-doc-overwrite-confirm-
# declined / -accepted pin the # BL-099-CONFIRM gate without a pty, and what
# T-mutation-confirm mutates. The production guard is unchanged for real
# terminals: with a tty the gate still prompts via prompt_yes_no (default N).
#
# HERMETICITY: every run pins CDF_HOME to a nonexistent path (BL-001 CDF refresh
# gracefully skips — no clone, no network), configures a git identity in each
# fixture, unsets GITHUB_BASE_REF, feeds </dev/null + SOIF_NONINTERACTIVE=1 so no
# prompt is reachable, and creates NO real remotes. bash-3.2 safe. The suite
# READS the real init.sh (to derive the shipped set) but never EXECUTES it, so it
# stays fast-lane eligible (mirrors tests/test-scaffold-source-closure.sh).
#
# FAST-LANE JUSTIFICATION: registered in BOTH tests/full-project-test-suite.sh
# and the tests.yml `unit` list. It drives the real upgrade-project.sh against
# the real framework tree (a few file copies + a graceful CDF skip) and does NOT
# invoke init.sh — so it honours the no-init fast-lane invariant.

# ── MUTATION HARNESS (review round 2) ───────────────────────────────────────
# Round 1's mutation tests excised the marker LINE. That is fine when the marker
# rides on the load-bearing statement, but it proves nothing about a marker that
# rides on a comment — and a test that only asserts "the marker string is present"
# is a tautology. Round 2 therefore attacks the FUNCTION BODY and leaves the
# marker string in place: every mutation below verifies the marker still greps in
# the mutant, then proves behaviour broke anyway.
#
# _neuter_fn <file> <fn> <body> — replace fn's whole body with <body>, keeping the
# signature (and every marker comment in the file) untouched. bash-3.2 / BSD-awk
# safe; matches a `<fn>() {` header at column 0 and the closing `}` at column 0.

# ── SILENT-SUCCESS `cp` STUB (review round 3) ───────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS EXISTS. _bl099_write_ok is `[ "$1" -eq 0 ] && cmp -s "$2" "$3"` — a
# status check AND a byte re-read. Round 2's two write-failure fixtures make the
# destination unwritable with `chmod`, so `cp` EXITS NON-ZERO and the status half
# alone already catches them: the round-3 verifier deleted the `cmp -s` half and
# all 28 tests stayed green. The byte re-read — the whole reason the function is
# belt-and-braces — was pinned by nothing.
#
# The hole that leaves is REACHABLE: a `cp` that RETURNS 0 WITHOUT LANDING THE
# BYTES. Short write, ENOSPC, a destination that swallows writes, a shadowed `cp`
# earlier on PATH. Status-only would print [OK] and exit 0 for a doc that was never
# written — this repo's canonical silent-success defect class. `chmod` cannot
# produce that state (an unwritable target makes cp FAIL, loudly), so no fixture
# built out of file modes can ever pin the byte re-read. A lying `cp` can.
#
# MECHANISM (chosen over the alternatives, and deliberately surgical). The house
# mock-CLI pattern (tests/host-drivers/mock-cli.sh) is "PATH-prepend a stub binary",
# and that is what this is — but a blanket `cp` stub is too blunt: upgrade-project.sh
# also cp's the whole vendored script set and the BL-088 skill files, so a global
# no-op cp would sabotage half the sync and the assertions would no longer be about
# doc-apply. So the stub is keyed on its DESTINATION: it lies about exactly one
# target and delegates to the REAL cp for every other destination, leaving the rest
# of the sync genuinely functional.
#
# Keyed on a destination GLOB, not an absolute path, on purpose: on macOS `mktemp -d`
# hands back /var/folders/… while the script's own PROJECT_ROOT resolves through the
# /private/var/… symlink, so an absolute-path equality test would silently never
# match and the test would pass vacuously. The `.hits` witness file below is the
# backstop for that entire class of mis-wiring — every test asserts the stub was
# ACTUALLY exercised, so a stub that failed to take effect fails the test instead of
# quietly making it green.
#
# HERMETIC + SCOPED: the stub directory is only ever prepended to PATH inside the
# sync subshell (_run_sync_stubcp). The test harness's own file operations —
# make_fake_framework's `cp -R`, the fixtures, _md5file — run in the parent shell
# with the untouched PATH and are completely unaffected.

# THE FIXTURE THE ROUND-2 SUITE WAS MISSING. Both round-2 write-failure tests use
# `chmod` to make the destination unwritable, so `cp` exits NON-ZERO and the
# `[ "$1" -eq 0 ]` half of _bl099_write_ok catches them on its own. This one drives
# a `cp` that EXITS 0 AND COPIES NOTHING — the short-write / ENOSPC / shadowed-cp
# shape — where the status is a lie and the byte re-read (`cmp -s`) is the ONLY
# thing between the operator and a false "[OK] your doc was updated".
#
# Both mutating branches are exercised, because they fail through different code:
#   (a) sidecar   — `cp src → <doc>.new` lies; nothing lands; must refuse loudly.
#   (b) overwrite — the BACKUP uses the real cp (it lands and verifies), and then
#       `cp src → <doc>` lies. The restore-from-backup cp is stubbed too, which is
#       realistic and harmless: the doc was never written, so it still holds the
#       operator's original bytes and the code's own `cmp -s "$bak" "$pfile"`
#       confirms it and says so.
# In BOTH: loud [FAIL] naming the doc, non-zero exit, NO [OK] line for that doc,
# and the operator's original left byte-intact.

#
# ROUND-4 FIX — the round-3 assertion was VACUOUS. It grepped the SUBSTRING
# 'skipped user-guide.md', which ALSO appears in the overwrite branch's
# consent-denial line ("skipped user-guide.md — in-place overwrite NOT confirmed").
# So flipping the fallback to `overwrite` still "passed": the fallback routed into
# the overwrite arm, but the # BL-099-CONFIRM SECOND gate (prompt_yes_no → deny in
# the probe) then refused the write and printed a message that STILL contained the
# substring. The test was really pinning the confirm gate, not the fallback.
#
# The `*)` skip arm prints EXACTLY `    skipped <label>.` (trailing period, nothing
# after). The overwrite-consent-denial prints `    skipped <label> — …NOT confirmed…`.
# We now assert the EXACT default-skip line (anchored `\.$`) AND the absence of the
