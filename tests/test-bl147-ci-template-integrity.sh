# suite over templates/pipelines/** (the PR-sweep remediation wave's shared
# asset). Each WP of the wave adds its cases here; WP-1 opens the file.
#
# WP-1 (BL-147 + BL-151): the emitted CI approval-log integrity steps were
# VACUOUS under every standard Actions checkout — `git diff origin/main...HEAD
# -- APPROVAL_LOG.md 2>/dev/null` dies `fatal: bad revision` on the default
# depth-1 clone (no origin/main ref), the `2>/dev/null` eats it, and the step
# PASSES on a tampered log. Parity hole: 7 of 10 GitHub language templates
# never got the steps at all. And gitleaks-action needs GITLEAKS_LICENSE for
# org accounts + fetch-depth 0 — neither was set (BL-151), so org-track
# generated projects got a failing/license-less secret-scan step.
#
# WP-1 CASES (all github CI templates unless noted):
#   (a) checkout step carries `fetch-depth: 0`
#   (b) every github CI template contains BOTH governance approval steps
#       (integrity + author verification) — all 10, not just python/ts/other
#   (c) no APPROVAL_LOG-touching line carries `2>/dev/null` (github + gitlab)
#   (d) the diff base is resolved explicitly (github.base_ref, loud-fail via
#       `git rev-parse --verify`) — never bare `origin/main...HEAD`
#   (e) no template uses `gitleaks/gitleaks-action`; every github CI template
#       runs the gitleaks CLI (`./gitleaks git`)
#   (f) gitlab twin of (c)/(d): the gitlab approval steps use the explicit
#       base + loud-fail and drop the silencer
#
# GRAMMAR: the template lists are derived MECHANICALLY (find), never
# hand-enumerated, guarded by a count floor (>=10 github CI files) so the
# suite cannot pass vacuously.
#
# REGISTRATION: content-pin only — no init.sh, not an aggregator -> BOTH the

# WP-2 (BL-148 + BL-153): semgrep surface modernization + hook-parity policy
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The emitted CI SAST rode on the ARCHIVED semgrep/semgrep-action (github) and
# the RENAMED returntocorp/semgrep image (gitlab + bitbucket) — both dead
# namespaces. And the gitleaks step used the OLD `detect --source` command +
# the personal `zricethezav/gitleaks:latest` image (unpinned). WP-2:
#   • github: semgrep moves to a `semgrep/semgrep` CONTAINER JOB whose flags
#     EQUAL the local pre-commit hook's policy — CI and the dev hook enforce
#     the IDENTICAL ruleset (parity is the contract).
#   • gitlab + bitbucket: rename the semgrep image off returntocorp, bring the
#     flags to hook parity, and modernize gitleaks (detect --source -> dir;
#     :latest -> a version-pinned ghcr image).
#   • BL-201 (2026-07-31): the semgrep image FLOATS (`semgrep/semgrep:latest`).
#     Karl's recorded decision (backlog BL-201, rationale on BL-192): a pinned
#     scanner ages out of new detections silently — stale is the invisible
#     failure. The agreed price is reproducibility, paid consciously by logging
#     `semgrep --version` in EVERY semgrep job. Cg4/Cg5 pin the floating tag
#     AND the log line, and REFUSE a re-pinned (`semgrep/semgrep:X.Y.Z`) or
#     log-less template. gitleaks stays version-pinned (Cg6) — the float
#     decision is semgrep-specific, made safe by BL-198 (no gate clause reads
#     anything semgrep prints, so version drift can only ADD findings loudly).
#
# PARITY DERIVATION (single source): the expected semgrep flag set is DERIVED
# from the hook's own `semgrep scan` invocation in scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh
# — never retyped here. If the hook's policy changes, this suite tracks it.
#
# WP-2 CASES:
#   Cg1  no templates/pipelines file references semgrep/semgrep-action or
#        returntocorp/semgrep (GLOBAL — github, gitlab, bitbucket, release, …)
#   Cg2  every github CI template carries a `semgrep scan --config` invocation
#   Cg3  every github semgrep invocation's config/severity/--error EQUAL the hook
#   Cg4  every github CI template declares the FLOATING `image:
#        semgrep/semgrep:latest` container AND logs `semgrep --version` (BL-201)
#   Cg5  every non-github (gitlab+bitbucket) semgrep step uses the floating
#        image with hook-parity config/severity/--error flags AND a version log
#   Cg5-scan-exec (BL-206 item 2) every non-github semgrep template carries an
#        EXECUTABLE `semgrep scan --config` line — the Cg2 analogue this half
#        never had, so a scan line lost to a `#` now FAILS instead of feeding
#        the parity comparison from the grave
#   Cg5-scan-exec-fixtures / Cg-extract-strip (R-BL206-2) the two item-2 atoms,
#        pinned on heredocs instead of on a hand-mutated template: the
#        `^[^#]*` guard and the extractor's comment strip. Both were measured
#        UNPINNED at the first cut (each mutant survived the full suite)
#   Cg-no-repin  every executable `semgrep/semgrep` reference under
#        templates/pipelines is EXACTLY `:latest` — numeric/digest/named-tag
#        pins and the bare spelling all refused (backstop beyond the
#        Cg4/Cg5 per-file lists)
#   Cg-no-repin-strip-controls (BL-206 item 3, RETREATED) the sweep keeps the
#        NAIVE never-accuse strip; the quoted-`#` evasion is an ACCEPTED limit
#        asserted as documented-miss fixtures, alongside the three innocent
#        line shapes a quote-aware strip was measured to ACCUSE (R-BL206-1)
#   Cg6  every non-github gitleaks step is modernized: no `detect --source`,
#        runs `gitleaks dir`/`git`, off zricethezav, version-pinned image

# ── Derive the hook's semgrep policy (SINGLE SOURCE — never retyped) ─────────
# Join the hook's `semgrep scan …` invocation across its line-continuations,
# then read the --config / --severity / --error tokens off it. The staged-files
# array + stderr redirect carry no config/severity token, so they drop out.
#
# BL-194-DERIVE-ANCHOR — WHY THIS IS ANCHORED ON A MARKER AND NOT ON THE COMMAND
# NAME. The collector used to scope with a bare, unanchored /semgrep scan/ over
# the whole file and never stripped comments, so the FIRST line mentioning the
# command won — and `# BL-112-MAX-TARGET-BYTES` documents the invocation in prose
# above it, carrying a FALSIFIER that necessarily names the command. That prose
# line has no trailing `\`, so the collector emitted it and exited: configs=''
# severity='' error=no. Cg3/Cg5 then compared 22 templates against the EMPTY
# policy and reported a config-parity break that did not exist, in a message that
# named parity rather than derivation — which is how it got mis-diagnosed as a
# real hook/CI divergence. Matching on a name that prose is entitled to use is
# the defect; the fix is to start at a marker prose is not entitled to forge.
# This is the same shape as `_build_unit_list_set`'s unanchored `tests=(` scoper
# (see CLAUDE.md CANONICAL COMMANDS) — an awk scoper that reads comments.
#
# FALSIFIER: in scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh, move the `# BL-194-HOOK-SEMGREP-POLICY`
# marker line to the very top of the file (above the FALSIFIER prose) and re-run
# this suite — Cg-derive goes RED naming the marker, and does NOT silently derive
# the prose. Cg-derive-prose-immune / Cg-derive-marker-required below pin both
# halves on fixtures, so this does not depend on the live file's current shape.

# ── Cg-derive-comment-widths: pin the SPELLING of the comment skip ─────────────
# BL-181's lesson, applied before it costs anything: a one-character narrowing of
# a comment predicate passes every check while re-opening the hole. The skip is
# `sub(/^[[:space:]]*/,"",probe)` then `probe ~ /^#/`. Of its two candidate atoms,
# exactly ONE is load-bearing, and this case pins that one only — the fixture puts
# both comment forms between the anchor and the invocation, so a form the narrowed
# predicate stops recognising is collected AS the policy, fails the `semgrep scan`
# acceptance check, finds no further anchor, and derives nothing.
#   • PINNED — `#` -> `#[[:space:]]`. Requiring a blank after `#` stops
#     `#no-space-after-hash` from being a comment. MEASURED: the narrowed form
#     fails this suite (57/1); restored, 58/0.
#   • NOT PINNED, because it is BEHAVIOUR-NEUTRAL — `[[:space:]]*` -> `+`. Stated
#     plainly rather than asserted as covered: the `sub()` only STRIPS leading
#     blanks and the `^#` test runs on the result, so a column-0 comment is left
#     unchanged by either spelling and still matches. MEASURED both ways: both
#     report "recognised as comment", and the narrowed suite is 58/0. A fixture
#     claiming to pin it would pass for the wrong reason — which is worse than
#     leaving it unpinned and saying so.

# ATOMS THAT REMAIN UNPINNED, NAMED RATHER THAN ASSUMED COVERED. The practice
# CLAUDE.md uses for BL-181 two residuals: say which parts have no safety net.
#   1. `[[:space:]]*` -> `+` in the comment-skip `sub()`. BEHAVIOUR-NEUTRAL and
#      measured as such: the `sub()` only STRIPS leading blanks and the `^#` test
#      runs on the result, so a column-0 comment is unchanged by either spelling
#      and still matches. Checked across 11 line shapes on three awk
#      implementations (BWK, mawk, gawk): zero verdict differences, and the suite
#      is green under the narrowed form. A fixture claiming to pin it would pass
#      for the wrong reason.
#   2. The `HOOK_POLICY_OK` gate itself (# BL-194-DERIVE-GATE). Replacing its
#      condition with a constant false leaves this suite green, because the gate
#      only changes OUTPUT on a run that is already red. It is unpinned, and its
#      loss is a legibility regression rather than a correctness one — but it is
#      the whole point of the BL-194 work, so it is named here rather than
#      quietly trusted.
# The `!collecting` guard was ALSO listed here as unpinned, on the argument that
# a verdict could flip "only if such a line carries a --config". That claim was
# REFUTED (a `#` continuation with no trailing backslash imports the NEXT
# command flags wholesale), so it is now pinned by
# Cg-derive-continuation-comment above rather than documented away.

# ── BL-206-NAIVE-STRIP: cut at the FIRST `#`, and never accuse ───────────────
# ONE strip, used by BOTH halves of BL-206: extract_semgrep_policy (so a
# commented-out DECOY `semgrep scan --config` line can never become the compared
# policy) and the Cg-no-repin sweep.
#
# THIS IS A DELIBERATE RETREAT FROM A QUOTE-AWARE STRIP, AND THE REASON IS
# MEASURED. An earlier revision of this file shipped a quote-tracking awk strip
# (`# BL-206-QUOTE-AWARE-STRIP`) implementing the real YAML/shell rule — a `#`
# opens a comment only when unquoted AND at a line start or after a blank — to
# close R-BL201-5's quoted-`#` evasion. It carried a claim, in this header, that
# the strip "can only DROP a line from the deny set, never accuse a clean one".
# **That claim was FALSE.** Review R-BL206-1 refuted it with three families of
# line that a quote tracker ACCUSES and the naive cut never can, all confirmed on
# this host (each is a documented-miss control in Cg-no-repin-strip-controls):
#   1. NATURAL PROSE. `- name: Karl's build   # don't use semgrep/semgrep:1.170.0`
#      — the apostrophe in `Karl's` opens a phantom quote region, the real comment
#      is swallowed into it, and the apostrophe in `don't` closes it again, so the
#      tracker never sees a comment at all and hands the whole line to the deny
#      filter. PyYAML agrees the pin is comment text. MEASURED: ACCUSED under the
#      tracker, clean under the naive cut.
#   2. BACKSLASH ESCAPES. A quote tracker with no escape state miscounts `\"`,
#      e.g. `- run: echo "a\"b"   # old pin "semgrep/semgrep:1.170.0`. MEASURED:
#      ACCUSED.
#   3. PLAIN-SCALAR QUOTE PAIRING WITH THE COMMENT. One `"` in the scalar (an
#      inch mark, a stray quote) pairing with a `"` inside the comment, e.g.
#      `- name: The 6" ruler   # legacy pin "semgrep/semgrep:1.170.0`. MEASURED:
#      ACCUSED.
# The reviewer further verified that NO discriminator keeps the quoted-`#`
# carrier while refusing all three — the rescue direction is under-stripping, not
# a cleverer tracker. So the sweep returns to never-accuse semantics and the
# evasion is carried as a NAMED RESIDUAL (see the Cg-no-repin header). A test
# that false-FAILs an innocent template is worse than one with a documented,
# fixture-pinned blind spot: the first teaches operators to ignore the lane (the
# BL-122/BL-149 false-FAIL doctrine), the second is an honest, greppable limit.
#
# WHAT THIS STRIP IS, EXACTLY: `sed 's/#.*//'` — every line is truncated at its
# first `#`, whatever that `#` is quoting. It over-strips by construction, so it
# can only ever REMOVE text from consideration. That is the whole point, and it
# is why extract_semgrep_policy uses it too: extract must not inherit the
# accusation direction either (a `--error` dropped after a quoted `#` would fail
# Cg3/Cg5 parity on an innocent template — the same class of false FAIL).
strip_comments_naive() {   # <file> -> stdout: each line truncated at its first `#`
  sed 's/#.*//' "$1"
}

# extract a template's semgrep policy -> sets EX_CONFIGS EX_SEVERITY EX_ERROR
# BL-206-EXTRACT-COMMENT-STRIP — the compared line is chosen AFTER comment
# stripping. Before this, the collector greped the RAW file, so a commented-out
# `- semgrep scan --config=…` line still fed the Cg3/Cg5 parity comparison:
# commenting out ONLY that line in gitlab/python.yml left the suite at 63/0
# (measured, BL-206 item 2) — a dead line supplied a passing policy for a job
# that would scan nothing. Stripping matters in the other direction too: a
# trailing comment must not SUPPLY flags the executable line lacks
# (`… --config=A --config=B --config=C # --severity=ERROR --error` would
# otherwise pass parity over an invocation carrying neither).
# The strip is the NAIVE one on purpose (# BL-206-NAIVE-STRIP): on a scan line
# the real-tree quoted-`#` risk is nil — no `--config`-bearing line in
# templates/pipelines carries a `#` at all — while a quote-tracking strip would
# import the accusation direction R-BL206-1 refuted, and a dropped `--error`
# after a quoted `#` would false-FAIL Cg3/Cg5 parity on a template nobody broke.
# Pinned by Cg-extract-strip below, which is the ONLY thing standing between this
# line and the raw grep it replaced (# BL-206-EXTRACT-PIN).

# ── Cg-extract-strip (# BL-206-EXTRACT-PIN): the comment strip in the extractor
# R-BL206-2 (major): the first cut of this work left the strip UNPINNED. Reverting
# extract_semgrep_policy to its old raw `grep -E … "$file"` survived the FULL
# suite at 65/0 — the templates are clean, so nothing on the real tree can tell
# the two apart, and the whole hole would have walked straight back in on the
# next refactor. The RED that justified the change was produced by MUTATING a
# real template, which is not a standing guard: the moment the template is
# restored, the check is unwitnessed. These fixtures are the standing guard.
#
# Two shapes, both measured on the pre-fix code, in OPPOSITE directions:
#   • DECOY ABOVE — a commented-out scan line sits FIRST in file order, so the
#     raw `head -1` picks the dead line and the live one is never read. This is
#     R-BL201-3's exact shape.
#   • COMMENT SUPPLIES FLAGS — a trailing comment carrying `--error` on a line
#     whose executable half lacks it. A raw grep reads the whole line and reports
#     EX_ERROR=yes for an invocation that would never block a build. This is the
#     direction R-BL201-3 did not name, and it is the more dangerous one: it
#     makes an UNARMED scanner look armed.

# ── Cg-no-repin: every executable semgrep/semgrep ref is EXACTLY :latest ────
# BL-201-FLOAT-SWEEP: Cg4/Cg5 anchor only the files in TODAY'S lists; this
# sweep is the backstop that catches a pinned semgrep image in a file those
# lists never see — a new template family, a release pipeline, a copy-paste.
# The predicate is deny-by-default (review R-BL201-1: the first cut matched
# only `:[0-9]` and a DIGEST pin `@sha256:…` — the STRONGEST pin form — plus
# named tags like `:canary` sailed through): after stripping comments
# (whole-line and trailing), any line still carrying `semgrep/semgrep` must
# carry `semgrep/semgrep:latest` at a tag boundary, so numeric tags, digests,
# named tags, `:latest-nonroot`, and the BARE floating spelling are ALL
# refused — one canonical form.
#
# BL-206-QUOTE-BLIND-RESIDUAL (item 3, RETREATED — read this before "fixing" it):
# the strip is `sed 's/#.*//'` (# BL-206-NAIVE-STRIP), which truncates at the
# FIRST `#` on the line whatever that `#` is quoting. R-BL201-5 measured the
# consequence: `run: echo 'a#b' && docker run semgrep/semgrep:1.170.0` planted
# outside the per-file lists survives the whole suite, and so do a `${VAR#prefix}`
# carrier and a URL fragment. **That miss is now a DELIBERATE, ACCEPTED LIMIT,
# not an oversight**, and the four shapes are pinned as documented-miss CONTROLS
# in Cg-no-repin-strip-controls below, so re-closing it flips a fixture and
# forces the decision back through review rather than happening by accident.
#
# WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS BANNED. A quote-aware strip WAS built and shipped on
# this branch, then withdrawn: review R-BL206-1 refuted its central claim (that
# it could only drop lines, never accuse) with three families of innocent line it
# ACCUSES — natural prose with an apostrophe (`- name: Karl's build   # don't use
# semgrep/semgrep:1.170.0`), `\"` escapes, and a plain-scalar `"` pairing with a
# `"` inside the comment. All three reproduce on this host; all three are
# never-accuse controls below. The reviewer further established that no
# discriminator keeps the quoted-`#` carrier while refusing those three — the
# rescue direction is UNDER-stripping. Anyone re-attempting this must beat that
# result first, and must re-measure the three families, not just the carrier.
# The trade is deliberate: this sweep is a breadth BACKSTOP behind the per-file
# Cg4/Cg5 anchors, so its miss costs defence-in-depth, whereas a false FAIL on a
# clean template costs the lane its credibility (the BL-122/BL-149 doctrine).
#
# REMAINING residuals, named rather than papered over:
#   • line-granular — a single line carrying BOTH an acceptable and a pinned ref
#     escapes, because the deny filter is applied per line.
#   • quoted/parameter-expansion/URL-fragment `#` — the accepted limit above.
# The per-file Cg4/Cg5 anchors are the primary enforcement; this is the breadth
# backstop, and its own vacuity is covered by them (Cg4-container + Cg5-image
# already require 22 files to carry the image line, so an enumeration that found
# nothing here could not leave the suite green). gitleaks pins are untouched: the
# pattern is semgrep-specific by construction.

# BL-206-REPIN-PREDICATE — ONE predicate, run by the sweep AND by its fixtures,
# so the fixture cases below cannot drift away from what the sweep does.

# Thirteen fixtures (4 caught + 2 exempt + 4 documented misses + 3 never-accuse controls) through the SAME predicate the sweep runs, in THREE groups. Two
# of the groups assert things the sweep DOES; one asserts things it deliberately
# does NOT. Reading the group names is the whole point of the case.
#
#   A. CAUGHT (positive controls) — a pinned ref on a line with no comment
#      before it must be flagged, in each refused spelling. Without these the
#      other seven would pass against a predicate that refuses everything.
#   B. EXEMPT (intended) — a whole-line comment and a trailing comment naming an
#      old pin must NOT be flagged. Documentation is not a violation.
#   C. DOCUMENTED MISSES (# BL-206-QUOTE-BLIND-RESIDUAL) — the four R-BL201-5
#      carriers, asserted as MISSES. This is the bl132 boundary-re-pin
#      discipline: a limit that a fixture ASSERTS cannot quietly change. If you
#      close the evasion, these four go red and you must edit them on purpose,
#      which routes the decision back through review.
#      They sit beside three NEVER-ACCUSE controls from R-BL206-1 — the shapes
#      that killed the quote-aware strip. Those three must stay clean under any
#      future strip; they are the reason group C is a limit rather than a bug.
#      MEASURED against the withdrawn tracker on this host: each of the three is
#      ACCUSED by it and clean under the naive cut. They are the regression test
#      for the whole retreat.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The estate SHA-pins its GitHub Actions (BL-113), but the pins had drifted 1–3
# majors behind upstream (checkout v4→v7, setup-node v4→v7, action-gh-release
# v2→v3, golangci-lint-action v6→v9, …). WP-4 re-pins every action to its
# current release. These cases are a SHAPE guard ONLY — a 40-hex commit SHA + a
# trailing version comment on every `uses:` line under templates/pipelines/**
# and .github/workflows/*.yml, and on every action-bearing RELEASE_SETUP_ACTION
# entry in init.sh AND its sync sibling scripts/reconfigure-project.sh. NO
# network, NO version-freshness assertion: the currency WATCHER (does a pin LAG
# upstream?) is BL-150's deferred half, tracked under BL-109. The sole exemption
# is the build-time placeholder token `__SETUP_ACTION__` (init.sh/reconfigure
# substitute a SHA-pinned action at render time, BL-113).
#
# PRE-GREEN GUARD: on a fully-pinned tree these PASS by construction — the
# estate was already sha-pinned, only STALE. The RED half is proven by the
# pin-refresh diff itself and by the recorded mutation (bare `@vN` tag →
# Cp1-sha-pin RED). This is the sanctioned pre-green shape guard.
#
# WP-4 CASES:
#   Cp1  every `uses:` action ref (templates/pipelines/** + .github/workflows)

# ── Cw6 (walk 2026-08-02 ISSUE-006): the phase-gate CREDENTIAL comment block ─
# The gate's Phase 1→2 backstop verifies branch protection through an
# AUTHENTICATED host API read that no generated runner can perform: Actions
# exports no token into a step env (and the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN cannot read
# protection at all — no `administration` key in `permissions:`), and the
# gitlab/bitbucket governance jobs install only jq+git. That made the
# governance job STRUCTURALLY unpassable on the framework's own default happy
# path. `# WALK-ISSUE-006-CI-PROTECTION-SCOPE` converts that ONE check to a
# loud WARN in credential-less CI; this case pins the OTHER half — the emitted
# workflow has to SAY so, and has to name the token that re-arms hard
# enforcement. A silent exemption is how a downgraded check becomes a
# forgotten check.
#   Cw6-floor       every CI template across the three hosts runs the gate
#   Cw6-block       each carries the signature line, AS A COMMENT
#   Cw6-honest      each says UNVERIFIED (never "verified") about the skip
#   Cw6-guided      each names the guided walkthrough (--setup-ci-token) — the
#                   token path is RECOMMENDED, not merely available
#   Cw6-credential  each names its host's hard-enforcement credential
#   Cw6-wiring      github templates map the secret LIVE (executable YAML under
#                   an `env:` key, not a commented example). This is the pin
#                   that makes the walkthrough's result real: if the mapping is
#                   a comment, `--setup-ci-token` stores a secret NOTHING reads

# which discards the exit code entirely: a probe showed the gate printing [FAIL]
# and exiting 1 while the step graded GREEN, and the swallow message LIED (the
# script was found — it was the gate's verdict that failed, not the file). Under

# would run with a real credential and its verdict would still be thrown away.
# So the credential wiring and the exit-code contract are ONE pin, not two.
