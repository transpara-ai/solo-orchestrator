# tests/test-delta-db-ledger-close.sh — Delta Track D-B: THE RELEASE CUT CLOSES
# THE LEDGER ROWS IT SHIPPED.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §9.2 (THE THREE REFUSALS and
# the absolute property "performs no write of any kind before all three pass"),
# §9.3 (promotion, and the tag written LAST), §6.3 (BUGS.md's table format is
# PARSED BY SCRIPTS — its own header forbids format changes, so the delta link
# and now the version live in the EXISTING `Fix Reference` column and NEVER in
# a new one), §7.1 (`shipped_in`, write-once, through the seam), §5.2 (which
# ledger each class writes to). Karl's decision of 2026-08-09, recorded in
# .superpowers/sdd/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1/dB-ledger-close-brief.md.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1
# through WP8 precedent. The grep-able `CUTREL-LEDGER-*` markers in the product
# are this suite's citation primitive and its mutation addresses.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, AND WHY IT IS CLOSED HERE AND NOT AT `--close`
#
# `delta.sh --open` writes a REAL ledger row for every class (WP8, Karl's
# decision 3): a `| SEV-N | Open |` row in BUGS.md for fix / hotfix /
# security-patch, and a `**Status:** In Progress` block in FEATURES.md for
# feature. NOTHING EVER FLIPPED EITHER. `--complete-gate ledger_row` records
# only that the operator ATTESTS the row is filled; `--close` writes
# `.claude/delta-state.json` and deliberately nothing else; the cut wrote
# `shipped_in` into the state document and never touched the ledger. So every
# post-1.0 fix left a permanent apparently-open SEV-N row, monotonically, in
# the artefact this framework holds up as the bug record.
#
# CLOSE IS NOT SHIP, and marking the row at `--close` was rejected on the
# merits: a closed delta has reached nobody, so flipping the row there would
# state "this bug is fixed" before the fix exists for any user — a falsehood in
# the audit trail, which is the exact defect class this wave has been removing.
# The cut is the honest moment: it already loops the closed deltas to write
# `shipped_in`, so it knows precisely which shipped and in which version.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE THREE PROPERTIES THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR
#
# 1. THE FLIP IS PHASE B ONLY. §9.2's property is absolute and this suite
#    re-takes WP7's instrument with LEDGERS PRESENT: a whole-tree `find` +
#    per-file md5 manifest across every refusal, singly and in combination,
#    plus a separate tag count. A refusal that closed a bug row would be a
#    release that never happened claiming a fix that never shipped.
#
# 2. THE TABLE STILL PARSES. §6.3 is a HARD constraint. BUGS.md's own header
#    says "Do NOT change the table format", and scripts/test-gate.sh greps
#    `SEV-1.*Open`, `SEV-2.*Open`, `SEV-2.*Deferred` and `SEV-3.*Open` across
#    it. G1/G2 assert the nine shipped columns survive on EVERY row (a `|`
#    field count, not a spot check), that the header and separator rows are
#    byte-identical, and that the gate's own greps still find the table while
#    no longer counting the shipped row as open.
#
# 3. A FLIP THAT FAILS SAYS SO, AND CLAIMS NOTHING. This is WP8's `_ledger_write`
#    lesson one layer up. WP8 measured an unguarded `{ … } >> "$ledger"`
#    returning the FILENAME — non-empty — on failure, so the caller's
#    "did it produce output?" check read a failed write as success and the lie
#    reached the STATE DOCUMENT, not just the transcript. The defence here is
#    structural: the ONLY thing that promotes a row to "closed" is a RE-READ of
#    the file after the write (`# CUTREL-LEDGER-VERIFY`). The writer's exit code
#    is never the promoter. m3 makes the promoter unconditional and F1 kills it.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES, NEVER LABELS
#
# Every verdict below is asserted on a process EXIT CODE, on a file's BYTES, on
# a whole-tree manifest, or on `git tag --list`. None is asserted on a printed
# banner. CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is that a label and an exit predicate can
# disagree. Printed text IS asserted in two places — the specific-failure lines
# — and there it is the deliverable itself, paired every time with a positive
# control that shows the same probe seeing the line when it is there.
#
# THE CONTRACT UNDER TEST (scripts/cut-release.sh), D-B's addition in bold:
#     0   the release was cut, and every ledger row it shipped was closed
#     3-11 unchanged (WP7's refusals and write failures)
#    12   **the release WAS cut — changelog promoted, shipped_in recorded, tag
#         created — and one or more ledger rows could NOT be closed.** The
#         release is not failed for it (it genuinely happened) but the cut does
#         not report clean either, and the rows are named.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS
#
#   L — THE CLOSE ITSELF, over rows written by the REAL `delta.sh --open`
#     L1  a `fix` shipped -> its BUGS.md row reads `Fixed` and its Fix
#         Reference names BOTH the DELTA id and the version   KILLS m1, m4
#     L2  a `feature` shipped -> its FEATURES.md block reads
#         `**Status:** Complete (shipped in vX.Y.Z)`                KILLS m5
#     L3  BOTH CLASSES IN ONE CUT — the brief's "handle every class WP8
#         writes, not just BUGS.md", proven together rather than separately
#     L4  a project with NO ledger files at all still cuts clean (rc 0): the
#         benign case must not be turned into a failure by the guard
#     L5  THE PREFIX COLLISION, IN THE ONLY DIRECTION THAT CAN FAIL — shipping
#         `DELTA-100` (the SHORTER id) with a `DELTA-1000` row present. The
#         allocator zero-pads to three and keeps counting, so the two coexist
#         the moment a project passes 999 deltas.
#         *** THIS ROW USED TO SHIP THE LONGER ID AND WAS VACUOUS. ***
#         `index(cell, "DELTA-1000")` cannot mis-hit inside a `DELTA-100`
#         cell — there is nothing left of the cell for the extra `0` to match
#         — so a bare-`index()` regression passed the old L5 BY
#         CONSTRUCTION. An adversarial review stripped the boundary conjunct
#         at all three matcher sites and this suite returned 26/0 while the
#         mutant stamped `DELTA-1000 shipped in v1.2.1` onto a bug that
#         release never carried and reported `Closed 1` at rc 0. The live
#         direction is the short id; only it can collide  KILLS m8, m9
#     L6  THE SAME COLLISION IN FEATURES.md — a block whose `**Phase Built:**`
#         anchor names `DELTA-1000`, sitting AHEAD of the block that names
#         `DELTA-100`, while `DELTA-100` ships                     KILLS m10
#     L7  A FIX REFERENCE CELL NAMING TWO DELTAS — `DELTA-1000, DELTA-100`.
#         A single `index()` finds the prefix first, fails the boundary test
#         and stops, so the row that plainly names the shipped delta is
#         reported "no row naming it" at rc 12. The search must retry past a
#         rejected hit: narrowing must not lose a real match
#
#   A — THE FEATURES MATCHER IS ANCHORED TO THE WRITER'S OWN STRUCTURAL LINE
#     A1  a prose block that merely NAMES the delta, sitting ahead of the block
#         `_ledger_write` wrote -> the written block flips and the prose block
#         is BYTE-IDENTICAL. A block-anywhere match stamps the prose block
#         `Complete (shipped in vX.Y.Z)` and reports `[OK] Closed 1` at rc 0 —
#         a false close reported as a clean cut                        KILLS m7
#     A2  the prose block is ALL there is -> this is the ROW-ABSENT path:
#         nothing written, the row-absent wording, rc 12
#     A3  the written block's own Summary names a DIFFERENT delta -> that
#         mention changes neither which block closes for its own id nor the
#         foreign id's answer ("no row naming it")
#
#   S — THE STAGING GUARD (`-s`, not `-e`) AND THE UNREADABLE LEDGER
#     S1  the flip transform dies producing NOTHING -> the write is refused and
#         the ledger is byte-identical. `-e` would pass empty content to a
#         truncating redirect and blank the project's bug record   KILLS m6
#     S2  BUGS.md AT MODE 000 -> the release COMPLETES (changelog, shipped_in,
#         TAG) and answers rc 12 naming unreadability specifically.
#         *** THIS HAZARD IS CREATED BY THIS BRANCH. *** The base
#         (`git show 27393de:scripts/cut-release.sh | grep -c 'BUGS.md\|
#         FEATURES.md'` -> 0) never opened a ledger, so there was no abort
#         window between `shipped_in` and the tag. Every read here is an
#         unguarded command substitution under `set -euo pipefail` and awk
#         exits 2 on a file it cannot open, so before this row the cut died
#         at rc 2 with NOT ONE WORD printed — after promoting the changelog
#         and recording `shipped_in`, and before the tag. `shipped_in` is
#         write-once, so the next run refuses at 8 and the operator can never
#         reach the tag through this tool again              KILLS m11
#     S3  THE SAME AT FEATURES.md, AND IT IS NOT THE SAME CODE PATH. The
#         obvious guard — `rstate="$(_cutrel_bugs_state …)" || rstate=
#         unreadable` — is WRONG BY LEDGER on bash 3.2: `set -e` is suspended
#         underneath a guarded command, so inside it the FEATURES reader's own
#         `blk="$(_cutrel_features_block …)"` stops aborting, normalises to
#         block 0 and answers `none` — SUCCESSFULLY. That guard reports
#         `unreadable` for BUGS.md and `none` for FEATURES.md over the same
#         `chmod 000`, and `none` prints "has no row naming it" about a row
#         that may be sitting right there. Measured, not reasoned
#
#   G — §6.3's HARD CONSTRAINT: THE TABLE STILL PARSES
#     G1  every `|`-row in BUGS.md still has exactly NINE columns, the header
#         and separator rows are BYTE-IDENTICAL, and the file grew no rows
#     G2  scripts/test-gate.sh's own four greps still find the table, and the
#         shipped row has left the `SEV-1.*Open` count by exactly one
#
#   N — §9.2: A REFUSAL WRITES NOTHING, WITH LEDGERS PRESENT
#     N1  ALL THIRTEEN refusals, singly and in combination, over a project that
#         HAS an open BUGS.md row and an open FEATURES.md block — whole-tree
#         manifest and tag set both unmoved. The original nine were
#         {3,4,5,5,3,4,6,7,8}; rc 9 (both arms — an unscored class AND a class
#         nobody could READ) and BOTH rc 10 arms are added here because WP7
#         pins rc 9 WITHOUT ledgers and "it is pre-ledger by code read" is an
#         argument, not a measurement.
#
#         THE rc-10-FAILS ARM WAS EXCLUDED ONCE, ON A RATIONALE THAT WAS
#         OVER-SCOPED, and the razor above is what retired it. The factual
#         half is true — `run-phase3-validation.sh` archives scan JSON and
#         summaries under `RESULTS_DIR="docs/test-results/phase3"` — but it
#         only forces an exclusion if the row runs the REAL validator.
#         `cut-release.sh` writes nothing on that path itself; the component
#         it invokes does. Driven against a stub exiting 1 — the same
#         `stub_revalidation` every other row here already uses — the arm is
#         hermetic and the manifest holds. An assertion that is measurable
#         today does not get to be an argument
#
#   NS — WHAT THE OPERATOR IS TOLD TO COMMIT
#     NS1 step 1 of the printed next-steps NAMES THE LEDGERS THIS CUT WROTE.
#         It used to read `git add CHANGELOG.md .claude/delta-state.json` even
#         when the run had just reported closing rows, so an operator
#         following the four steps verbatim pushed a release whose commit
#         OMITTED the closes — the flip left uncommitted in the working tree,
#         the branch's bug record still reading Open. Asserted in both
#         directions: named when rows closed (both ledgers, from L3's
#         two-class cut), absent when nothing closed (L4)
#
#   F — HONESTY WHEN THE FLIP FAILS (WP8's lesson, one layer up)
#     F1  the ledger is UNWRITABLE -> the run names the row specifically,
#         records no claim it did not honour, the row still reads open, THE
#         RELEASE STILL COMPLETES (changelog, shipped_in, tag) and the exit
#         code is 12 rather than 0                          KILLS m2, m3
#     F2  the ledger exists but has NO ROW for the delta -> named
#         specifically, distinct wording from F1, rc 12, tag still created
#
#   I — IDEMPOTENCE
#     I1  cut twice -> the second refuses at 8 and BUGS.md is byte-identical
#     I2  a row ALREADY `Fixed` at flip time is not an error (rc 0), is left
#         byte-identical, and the version text is not appended twice
#
#   C — THE CLASS MAP IS A SYNC SIBLING
#     C1  `_cutrel_ledger_for` (the closer) and `delta.sh::_ledger_for` (the
#         writer) are driven side by side over every class and agree. A
#         divergence is invisible until a shipped feature's row never closes.
#         The probe carries a POSITIVE CONTROL: the same lift over a
#         deliberately mutated private copy must return the mutated answer,
#         which is what proves the probe reads the sandbox and not the host
#
#   O — ORDERING (§9.3, WP7's cheapest-to-undo-first)
#     O1  the flip is AFTER the seam's ship write: with the ship action shimmed
#         to refuse, the cut stops at 11 and the ledger is byte-identical —
#         a refused ship must never leave a row claiming a version nobody tagged
#     O2  the flip is BEFORE the tag: asserted on marker order in the product
#
#   M — MUTATIONS (anchored end-of-line markers, sites==1, exactly one line
#       changed, `bash -n` on every mutant, mode preserved, fresh fixture each)
#     m1  suppress the flip            -> the row stays `Open`        L1 RED
#     m2  suppress the honesty arm     -> a failed flip reports a CLEAN cut,
#         rc 0, which is the BL-213 shape                             F1 RED
#     m3  promote without re-reading   -> a failed flip is COUNTED and claimed;
#         this is WP8's lie reaching the record, one layer up          F1 RED
#     m4  drop the version append      -> the row reads `Fixed` and names no
#         release, so the audit trail cannot say WHICH one carried it  L1 RED
#     m5  route `feature` to BUGS.md   -> the FEATURES.md block never closes,
#         and the BUGS table gains nothing, so the loss is silent      L2 RED
#     m6  `-s` -> `-e` on the stage    -> empty staged content reaches a
#         TRUNCATING redirect and the bug record becomes zero bytes;
#         killed on the FILE, because both guards answer rc 12 here     S1 RED
#     m7  unanchor the FEATURES match  -> the prose block is stamped and the
#         run reports `Closed 1` at rc 0                                A1 RED
#     m8  strip the boundary conjunct in the STATE reader -> the shipped row
#         really is flipped and the mutant STILL answers rc 12 over it,
#         because the re-read mis-hits the neighbouring open row. Killed on
#         the CONTRADICTION between the verdict and the bytes            L5 RED
#     m9  strip it in the FLIPPER      -> the DELTA-1000 row this release
#         never touched is stamped `shipped in v1.2.1`. Killed on THE WRONG
#         ROW'S BYTES — the brief's requirement, and the m6 lesson: a
#         message-based predicate passes over harm it never looks at   L5 RED
#     m10 strip it in the FEATURES block chooser -> the wrong feature block is
#         completed. Killed on THE WRONG BLOCK'S BYTES                  L6 RED
#     m11 delete the readability guard -> `chmod 000 BUGS.md` kills the run
#         dead at rc 2 with no message, after `shipped_in` and before the
#         tag. Killed on STATE, not on silence: the record says the work
#         shipped in a version that `git tag --list` does not contain  S2 RED
#
#   THE THREE `# CUTREL-LEDGER-IDBOUND-*` SITES ARE MUTATED SEPARATELY, and that
#   is the whole point of m8/m9/m10 being three rows. They are one rule written
#   out three times because they are three awk programs, and each is separately
#   lethal in a different direction — a false FAILURE, a false CLOSE, and a
#   false close on the other ledger. A single mutant that stripped all three at
#   once would still be one address, and one address is what let the previous
#   version of this suite return 26/0 with every one of them gone.

# no way to reach that state from the fixture alone: the flip transform prints
# every line of its input, so its output is empty only if its input is empty —
# and an empty ledger is classified `none` and never reaches the write at all.
# The failure the guard exists for (`a transform that died halfway must not be
# allowed to blank a project's bug record`) therefore has to be INDUCED.
#
# IT IS INDUCED AT ONE SEAM AND NOWHERE ELSE. `-v ver=` is passed by
# cut-release.sh's two ledger FLIP transforms and by nothing else anywhere in
# scripts/ (`grep -rn -- '-v ver=' scripts/` returns those two lines). So the
# state READ that classifies the row as open, the changelog promotion, the seam
# and every other awk in the run reach the real awk untouched, and the ONLY
# thing that changes is that the staged content arrives empty — through the
# product's own `> "$stage"` redirect, at the product's own guard.
#
# The probe exits NON-ZERO as a dying transform really would. That rc is
# deliberately not what is being tested: the product writes `|| true` after the
# transform, precisely because a transform's own answer is not evidence, so the
# `-s` guard is the only thing standing between a dead transform and a blanked
# ledger. Two things prove the probe took effect rather than breaking the run
# somewhere earlier: it LOGS every suppression (asserted to be exactly one), and

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE BUGS TABLE HAS A COLUMN FOR THIS AND FEATURES.md DOES NOT. §6.3 gives the
# delta link one cell — `Fix Reference` — so the BUGS matcher can require a
# nine-column row and read field 9, and free text elsewhere in the file cannot
# reach it. A Feature block is prose with a few bolded labels, so a matcher that
# takes the id ANYWHERE in the block takes it out of a Summary too: a feature
# whose description merely says "superseded by DELTA-007" gets stamped
# `**Status:** Complete (shipped in vX.Y.Z)` and the run reports `[OK] Closed 1`
# and exits 0. A FALSE CLOSE REPORTED AS A CLEAN CUT — the same defect class
# this whole change removes one level up, reintroduced by the fix for it.
#
# `delta.sh::_ledger_write` puts the id on its own structural line, and that is
# the line the match is anchored to. What the writer actually emits for the
# feature class (read out of the function, not out of a brief):
#
#     ## Feature <n>: <slug>
#     **Phase Built:** 4 (post-1.0 <id>)
#     **Status:** In Progress
#     **Summary:** <describe>
#     …
#
# The id appears on `**Phase Built:**`, and on `**Brief:**` when a brief path
# carries it — but `**Phase Built:**` is the one the writer emits unconditionally
# for every feature it opens, so that is the anchor. A block with no such line
# is not a block this framework wrote, and the cut says "no row naming it"
# rather than guessing: rc 12 and a human closes it by hand, which is the safe
# direction when the alternative is stamping a shipped version onto somebody
# else's feature.

# A1 — TWO BLOCKS, ONE ID. Block A only talks about the delta; block B is the
# one `delta.sh --open` wrote. B must flip and A must be BYTE-IDENTICAL — bytes,

# refuses at 8 with nothing to release: the repository is left permanently
# holding a record that says the work shipped in a version no tag names.
