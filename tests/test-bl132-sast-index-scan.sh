# tests/test-bl132-sast-index-scan.sh — BL-132: the pre-commit SAST arm must scan
# the STAGED CONTENT (the bytes being committed), not the WORKTREE bytes.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (BL-118 adversarial verification, PR #199)
#   The armed pre-commit SAST arm handed semgrep the staged PATHNAMES
#   (`git diff --cached --name-only`), so semgrep read whatever was on DISK — which
#   need not be the staged bytes. Repro: `git add app.ts` (containing the XSS),
#   overwrite the worktree app.ts with a clean version, `git commit` -> the commit
#   LANDS with the `[OK]` receipt while `git show HEAD:app.ts` still holds the
#   vulnerable innerHTML. `git add -p` / stage-then-edit share the hole in the
#   benign direction (a false block on unstaged edits). The fix materializes the
#   staged blobs into a temp tree (# BL-132-INDEX-SCAN in scripts/lib/hook-
#   templates.sh) and points semgrep there, mapping finding paths back.

#   T-index-blocks-staged-vuln    live — stage innerHTML XSS, overwrite the worktree
#                                 copy CLEAN, commit -> REFUSED (the STAGED bytes are
#                                 scanned), HEAD unmoved, [BLOCKED], and the real
#                                 path app.ts appears (temp-prefix mapping).
#                                 RED pre-fix: commit LANDS with [OK].
#   T-index-no-false-block        live — stage CLEAN, overwrite the worktree copy
#                                 with the vuln, commit -> LANDS (the unstaged vuln
#                                 is not the committed bytes; no false block).
#   T-notrun-contract-intact      live — semgrep shimmed OFF the PATH -> the commit
#                                 LANDS and the operator is told LOUDLY that SAST did
#                                 not run ([WARN] semgrep not found + SAST NOT
#                                 ENFORCED). The refactor must not disturb the
#                                 # BL-112-SAST-NOTRUN contract.
#   T-index-gitlink-not-blinding  live — a staged SUBMODULE GITLINK alongside a staged
#                                 vuln must NOT blind the scan. RED pre-fix: index
#                                 mode 160000 is not a blob, `git cat-file blob :sub`
#                                 exits 128, the loop `break` discarded EVERY already-
#                                 materialized target and the whole commit went NOTRUN
#                                 -> the sibling vuln LANDED (# BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP).
#   T-index-gitlink-only-honest   live — a submodule POINTER-BUMP commit (only a
#                                 gitlink staged, nothing scannable) LANDS but must
#                                 NOT print an `[OK] semgrep: SAST ran` receipt it did
#                                 not earn — 0 materialized targets => loud NOTRUN.
#   T-index-case-collision        live — BL-178: two staged paths differing only in
#                                 case collide in a single flat temp tree on a case-
#                                 INSENSITIVE filesystem; the later (clean) write
#                                 clobbers the earlier (vuln) blob and the vuln lands
#                                 with a false [OK]. Per-index subdirs
#                                 (# BL-178-PER-INDEX-DIR) make the collision
#                                 impossible. LOUD-SKIPs on a case-sensitive FS
#                                 (unobservable there, would pass vacuously).
#   T-index-stage-syntax-path     live — R-270-1B: a repo-ROOT staged path named
#                                 `0:`..`3:`<something> collides with git's
#                                 `:<stage>:<path>` MERGE-STAGE revision syntax, so the
#                                 bare `git cat-file -t ":$soif_p"` fails on a HEALTHY
#                                 blob; it is no gitlink, so it fell through to the
#                                 then-existing `soif_idx_ok=0; break` (retired by
#                                 # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP) and the WHOLE commit went
#                                 NOTRUN while a vulnerable sibling LANDED. The stage-0
#                                 prefix (# BL-132-STAGE0-REF) disambiguates; after
#                                 BL-182 the same entry would instead forfeit the
#                                 commit's [OK] receipt, so the prefix still earns it.
#                                 RED pre-fix: COMMITTED + "could not materialize".
#   T-rename-edit-scanned         live — BL-179: `diff.renames` defaults TRUE, so a
#                                 rename-AND-edit commit is one status-R entry, which
#                                 `--diff-filter=ACM` EXCLUDED. soif_staged came back
#                                 empty and the arm (a `-gt 0` wrapper with no `else`)
#                                 was skipped IN SILENCE. Filter -> ACMR. RED pre-fix:
#                                 COMMITTED with ZERO SAST lines in the log.
#   T-rename-only-not-silent      live — the residual R100 shape: a content-free rename
#                                 must LAND but still be RECEIPTED. Pins the SILENCE.
#   T-delete-only-honest          live — D stays OUT of the filter (do NOT copy the
#                                 BL-125 arm's ACMDR): a deleted path has no staged
#                                 blob, so including it would manufacture an unreadable
#                                 entry. Deletion-only must land, be receipted, and
#                                 never reach the loop with a blob-less entry.
#   T-typechange-scanned          live — R-WPC-1: a staged TYPE CHANGE (status letter T,
#                                 e.g. a symlink materialized into a regular file) is a
#                                 real blob with real content, and `--diff-filter=ACMR`
#                                 EXCLUDED it. A clean sibling kept soif_staged non-empty,
#                                 so the commit never reached the empty-staged report and
#                                 instead printed `[OK] … on 1 staged file(s)` over TWO
#                                 staged blobs. Filter -> ACMRT. RED pre-fix: COMMITTED
#                                 with that unearned receipt and the sink in HEAD.
#   T-partial-clean-no-receipt    live — BL-182: one staged entry cannot be
#                                 materialized, every other scans CLEAN. That is NOT a
#                                 clean commit: NO [OK] receipt, loud NOTRUN, and the
#                                 unreadable entry NAMED. RED pre-fix: the whole-commit
#                                 abort names nothing and leaks a raw tool diagnostic.
#   T-partial-vuln-still-blocks   live — BL-182, the regression the all-or-nothing
#                                 `break` actually caused: one unreadable entry
#                                 DISCARDED every materialized sibling, so a sibling's
#                                 sink LANDED. A partial scan that finds a vuln must
#                                 still [BLOCKED].
#   T-gitlink-not-counted-unread  live — the two per-entry `continue`s mean OPPOSITE
#                                 things: a gitlink is skipped with NO trace (not
#                                 content), an unreadable entry forfeits the whole
#                                 commit's [OK] and is named. Pins the ACCEPT direction
#                                 of the mode predicate; the REJECT direction is the
#                                 case below (its unreadable entry is a HEALTHY blob
#                                 that fails at the WRITE site, so it never enters the
#                                 non-blob branch at all).
#   T-nonblob-nongitlink-forfeits-receipt
#                                 live — R-WPC2-1: a staged entry that is neither a blob
#                                 nor a gitlink (a TREE object staged at index mode
#                                 100644) must forfeit the receipt and be NAMED. Pins
#                                 the REJECT direction of # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP's mode
#                                 test. RED under a widened predicate: [OK] receipt over
#                                 a commit landing with an unscanned staged entry.
#   T-pathmax-sibling-caught      live — BL-182's original trigger: a repo-relative path
#                                 that overflows PATH_MAX under the mktemp temp root.
#                                 Fires at the dirname/mkdir recovery point (the

#                                 where the host can express the path.
#   T-mutation-rename-filter      live — proof (a): ACMRT -> ACMT -> the rename case

#                                 Needs no semgrep — an empty target set never reaches
#                                 the scanner.

#                                 -> restore per-entry recovery -> REFUSED (GREEN).
#   T-mutation-partial-receipt    live — proof (c): disarm the no-unearned-receipt guard
#                                 -> a clean-but-partial scan prints [OK] (RED) ->

#                                 LANDS behind an [OK] receipt (RED) -> restore ->
#                                 receipt forfeited and the entry named (GREEN).
#   T-oversize-blob-scanned       live — R-274R-1: a staged blob over semgrep's DEFAULT
#                                 --max-target-bytes (1,000,000) is dropped by the

#                                 file(s)` — the first member of this arm's silent-success

#                                 cannot become a silent-success path.
#   NOT IN THIS SUITE, AND THE ABSENCE IS DELIBERATE — THE PARSE/DECODE STAGE.
#                                 FIVE cases covering a `Parsed lines: ~N%` clause
#                                 (T-utf16-parse-drop-no-receipt, T-mutation-parse-coverage,
#                                 T-parse-coverage-fails-closed, T-parse-threshold-exact,
#                                 T-mutation-parse-threshold) were
#                                 written, measured and WITHDRAWN before merge. FIVE, NOT
#                                 SIX — the set difference against
#                                 origin/fix/bl112-sast-scan-coverage (e87dbd3) leaves SIX
#                                 parse-named cases, but T-parse-coverage-no-cry-wolf was
#                                 RENAMED to T-coverage-no-cry-wolf and KEPT (below), and
#                                 T-empty-target-receipt was KEPT and rescoped. Count the
#                                 withdrawals, not the renames. The clause
#                                 works on semgrep 1.157.0 and is BLIND on >= 1.171.0, where
#                                 the banner reads `Parsed lines: ~100.0%` for a file semgrep
#                                 never decoded. Do not re-add the cases without re-measuring
#                                 the instrument — a green suite on a pinned old semgrep is
#                                 exactly how this gap would ship. Filed as BL-192.
#   T-empty-target-receipt        live — the OTHER cry-wolf shape: a zero-byte staged file
#                                 (a .gitkeep, an empty __init__.py) must still EARN the
#                                 receipt. Written for the withdrawn parse clause and KEPT:
#                                 what survives is an unmeasured cry-wolf risk on the
#                                 SELECTION clause — a `Scanning 0 files` header would NOTRUN
#                                 every placeholder commit forever.
#   T-coverage-no-cry-wolf        live — the counter-objection that ruled `Targets scanned`
#                                 OUT must not apply to the clauses that DID ship: an
#                                 ordinary multi-language commit (ts + md + json + yml + sh)
#                                 must still EARN the [OK] receipt. A guard that NOTRUNs
#                                 normal commits is a gate people route around.
#   T-mutation-max-target-bytes   live — proof (a): strip the --max-target-bytes=0 line ->
#                                 the oversize sink is never scanned and the commit LANDS
#                                 (RED) -> restore -> REFUSED + [BLOCKED] (GREEN). Also
#                                 asserts the RED transcript carries NO [OK]: with the
#                                 flag gone the coverage guard must still hold the honesty
#                                 line even though the sink escapes.
#   T-mutation-scan-coverage      live — proof (b), the CLASS guard in isolation: with the

#                                 comments) is ACCEPTED and then the one rule that catches its
#                                 line-2 sink hits semgrep's default 5s per-rule timeout. Every
#                                 selection fact reads complete and the arm certified it. Must
#                                 be [BLOCKED] or a loud rule-coverage NOTRUN, never [OK].
#                                 DENSITY is the variable — comment padding cannot provoke it.
#   T-rule-timeout-names-the-rule live — the forfeited receipt names the TARGET and the exact
#                                 RULE that ran out of time, with the temp-tree prefix mapped
#                                 off (# BL-182-NAME-THE-ENTRY, where this arm CAN attribute).

#                                 restore -> forfeited + staged set named (GREEN). Selection is
#                                 left intact, so it proves the clause carries its own weight.
#   T-scan-status-singular-rule   stub — R-274Rv2-8: semgrep really prints the SINGULAR

#   The live cases talk to the semgrep registry (owasp/browser config fetch). A host

# ── T-index-stage-syntax-path (R-270-1B regression) ──────────────────────────
# git's REVISION syntax reads `:<0-3>:<path>` as a MERGE-STAGE reference, so a staged
# path whose REPO-ROOT name begins with `0:`, `1:`, `2:` or `3:` makes the BARE
# `git cat-file -t ":$soif_p"` FAIL on a perfectly healthy, fully readable blob
# ("fatal: path 'decoy.js' does not exist ..."). Verified boundaries (git 2.50.1):
#   0:x.js / 2:x.js / 3:x.js -> FAIL     4:x.js -> blob (only 0-3 are stage digits)
#   2evil.js -> blob (the colon is required)   sub/2:x.js -> blob (repo ROOT only)
# Such an entry is NOT a gitlink, so # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP does not `continue` it: it
# fell through to the loop's then-existing `soif_idx_ok=0; break` (that statement is
# GONE — # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP retired it; this paragraph is history, not a code
# citation), which DISCARDED every already-materialized sibling target and routed the
# WHOLE commit to the loud NOTRUN — so a genuinely vulnerable SIBLING file LANDED. That
# was a security-lane regression versus main, the same "one bad entry blinds the whole
# commit" mechanism as R-270-1 (the gitlink bug). THE CASE STILL EARNS ITS KEEP after
# BL-182: without the `:0:` prefix such an entry becomes an UNREADABLE entry, which now
# forfeits the commit's [OK] receipt over content that was readable all along.
# The fix pins the stage explicitly (`:0:$soif_p`, # BL-132-STAGE0-REF) at all three
# cat-file sites; `:0:` still resolves ordinary paths. The `:(literal)` gitlink probe
# is a PATHSPEC, not a revision, and was verified immune — it is deliberately unchanged.

# A staged TYPE CHANGE — git status letter T — is a real staged BLOB with real content,
# and `--diff-filter=ACMR` EXCLUDED it. Materializing a symlink into a regular file
# (`rm link.ts` then write it) is ordinary repo hygiene, and the resulting index entry
# holds whatever bytes the new regular file carries.
#   THIS IS NOT THE SAME SHAPE AS THE RENAME DEFECT, and that is why it needs its own
#   case. A rename-only commit left soif_staged EMPTY, so the # BL-179-EMPTY-STAGED arm
#   at least SAID something. Here a clean sibling keeps soif_staged non-empty, so the
#   commit never reaches that arm: it prints the `[OK] semgrep: SAST ran on N staged
#   file(s)` RECEIPT while N counts only the sibling and the unscanned T entry carries
#   the sink. That is the unearned-receipt class (# BL-182-NO-UNEARNED-RECEIPT) reached
#   through the FILTER instead of through the materialization loop — the loop never sees
#   the entry, so the guard after it cannot fire.
#   T IS SAFE TO INCLUDE WHERE D IS NOT (verified on this host, git 2.50.1):
#   `git cat-file -t ":0:<path>"` returns `blob` for a T entry in BOTH directions —
#   symlink->file (index mode 100644) and file->symlink (index mode 120000) — and for
#   gitlink->file. So, unlike D, T never manufactures a phantom unreadable entry and the
#   materialization loop needs no change. (A hypothetical ->gitlink T would present mode
#   160000 and be absorbed by # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP, which is already correct.)

  # The two per-entry `continue`s in the loop look identical and mean OPPOSITE things,
  # so the distinction needs a pin of its own. A GITLINK is not content: it is skipped
  # with NO trace and costs the commit nothing. An UNREADABLE entry IS content we owe a
  # scan of: it forfeits the whole commit's [OK] receipt and is reported by name.
  # Collapsing the two — in either direction — is a real hazard: treat a gitlink as
  # unread and every submodule commit loses its receipt (operators stop reading the
  # warning); treat an unreadable blob as a gitlink and an unscanned file buys a
  # clean-looking commit, which is the silent-success class itself.
  # SCOPE, STATED PRECISELY (R-WPC2-1 refuted the earlier "pins BOTH directions" claim):
  # this case pins the ACCEPT direction of the mode predicate — a real mode-160000 entry
  # is skipped untraced — and pins that an unreadable entry beside it still forfeits the
  # receipt. It does NOT reach the predicate's REJECT direction, because its unreadable
  # entry ($LONG_NAME) is a HEALTHY blob: `git cat-file -t :0:$LONG_NAME` returns `blob`,
  # so the non-blob branch that holds the mode test is never entered and widening that
  # test to a blanket skip leaves this case GREEN. T-nonblob-nongitlink-forfeits-receipt
  # below carries the REJECT direction; the two are a pair, not a duplicate.
  # Hermetic: the gitlink is a `--cacheinfo 160000` index row, so no submodule (and

# T-gitlink-not-counted-unread above pins the ACCEPT direction (mode 160000 => skip with
# no trace) and pins that a LONG_NAME entry still forfeits the receipt — but that entry
# is a HEALTHY blob whose materialization fails at the WRITE site, so it never enters
# the non-blob branch and the mode test is invisible to it. Widening the predicate to
# the blanket "unreadable => skip" that # BL-132-GITLINK-SKIP explicitly forbids was
# therefore INVISIBLE to every lane: the whole suite stayed 25/0 under it, and the
# commit landed carrying an unscanned staged entry behind an unearned [OK] receipt —
# the exact silent-success class BL-182 exists to retire (R-WPC2-1, reproduced A/B
# through the real emitter, the real .git/hooks/pre-commit and a real `git commit`).
# The fixture is a TREE object staged at index mode 100644: ls-files reports
# `100644 <sha> 0 weird.ts` so the 160000 test must REJECT it, while

# ── T-mutation-content-guard (F2: empty/partial materialize -> loud NOTRUN) ───
# The F2 size check turns an empty/partial materialization into a LOUD NOTRUN
# instead of scanning an empty file and passing [OK]. The GREEN direction fires
# BEFORE semgrep runs (no registry needed): force the materialization to write
# empty/partial dests and the content check must NOTRUN. The RED direction removes
# F2 so the empty scan passes [OK] silently (needs the registry, LOUD-SKIP if down).
#
# ANCHOR COUPLING — the two _idx_mutate anchors below are the EXACT emitted
# materialization line, matched literally (awk index(), `exit 3` unless it appears
# EXACTLY once). They are therefore coupled to # BL-132-STAGE0-REF: changing the
# emitted index reference (`:$soif_p` -> `:0:$soif_p`) makes this case report
# MIS-TARGETED rather than pass vacuously, and the anchor must be retargeted in
# lockstep. Keep the anchor a FULL literal — never relax it to a prefix that would
# match both the stage-explicit and the bare form, because the whole point of the
# exactly-once check is to notice when the surface it attacks has moved.
#   Second coupling, added with # BL-182-PER-ENTRY-SKIP: the materialization line is
#   now wrapped in a brace group (`{ … ; } 2>/dev/null`) so the SHELL's own "cannot
#   create" diagnostic cannot leak past the redirect. The literal above is still a
#   SUBSTRING of that line, so both mutants still splice cleanly — but if the group
#   is ever reshaped so the literal no longer appears verbatim, the exactly-once
#   check fires instead of the case quietly proving nothing.

# semgrep is the honest instrument for it: it tests THIS ARM'S PARSE of a banner, which is
# the property under test, and it says so in its name.
#   TWO FURTHER STUB CASES LIVED HERE AND WENT WITH THE WITHDRAWN PARSE CLAUSE
#   (T-parse-threshold-exact and T-mutation-parse-threshold, pinning the exact `>= 100`
#   threshold). Whoever restores a parse/decode clause restores them too — the threshold
#   was UNPINNED once already and a reviewer's `-ge 100` -> `-ge 99` mutant survived the
#   whole PR-blocking set. See BL-192.
#   IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE REAL-PATH CASES and must never become one. It is still
#   driven through the SHIPPED emitter, a real .git/hooks/pre-commit and a real
#   `git commit` — only the scanner is fabricated.
#   EVERY STUB CASE CARRIES ITS OWN CONTROL. A stub that broke the arm outright would make
#   a bare "the receipt was forfeited" assertion pass vacuously, so each case also runs a
#   banner that MUST earn the receipt.
# mk_stub_semgrep <dir> <header-tail> <parsed-value>: an executable `semgrep` in <dir>
# printing nothing on stdout, a two-line banner on stderr, exit 0 (clean scan, no findings).
#   THE `Parsed lines:` LINE IS KEPT THOUGH THE SHIPPED HOOK NO LONGER READS IT. A stub
#   whose banner is narrower than the real one would stop being a faithful instrument the
#   moment the arm reads anything else from it, and the line costs nothing. It is also the
#   fixture a restored parse clause needs back. NO BULLET GLYPH on it: it is multibyte and
#   this suite runs under `set -u` on C-locale hosts. The HEADER, by contrast, is anchored
#   ^…$ in the shipped hook, so its two leading spaces are reproduced exactly.

# ── T-scan-status-singular-rule (R-274Rv2-8: a measured permanent-NOTRUN cliff) ───
# The header parse hard-required the PLURAL `Code rules:` and semgrep really does print the
# singular: `semgrep scan --config=<one-rule.yml>` emits `Scanning 1 file with 1 Code rule:`
# on 1.157.0. A generated project whose resolved ruleset is one rule would therefore print
# `SAST NOT ENFORCED … CANNOT BE VERIFIED` on EVERY commit FOREVER — a permanent cliff, not
# a per-commit miss. Both spellings are accepted now; this pins that, and the mutant proves
# the cliff was real rather than hypothetical.
#   TWO ATOMS, PINNED BY THE TWO HALVES OF THIS CASE. The widening touched the counting
#   grep (`Code rules?:`) AND the extracting sed (`Code rules\{0,1\}:`), and a narrowing of
#   EITHER re-opens the cliff — an accepting grep with a rejecting sed still leaves
#   soif_sg_accepted empty. The GREEN half covers both: the receipt can only be earned if
#   the grep counts the header and the sed extracts its number. The RED half attacks the
#   grep specifically, to show the atom is decisive and not decoration.

# BL-198 — TRANSCODE-FIRST DECODE COVERAGE (# BL-198-TRANSCODE in the emitted hook).
# BL-192's gap: semgrep ACCEPTS a UTF-16 staged file, cannot decode it, scans it
# "clean", and the four-precondition receipt prints over an unseen sink — a positive
# false attestation. The fix classifies each materialized blob AFTER F2 (NUL scan →
# BOM longest-first → whole-file stride-aware zero-parity derivation, BOM and
# derivation required to AGREE), transcodes vouched UTF-16/UTF-32 to UTF-8 at the
# IDENTICAL tree path (temp + mv, never a redirect into the source), and fails
# CLOSED to a loud named NOTRUN on anything it cannot vouch. These cases are the
# fixture matrix from the BL-198 plan; five restore the shape of the cases withdrawn
# with the BL-186 parse clause (held on PR #278 @ e87dbd3), re-aimed off semgrep's
# self-report onto the transcode — the UTF-16 sink cases flip from "receipt
# forfeited" to the stronger "sink CAUGHT, commit BLOCKED".
#   Every fixture asserts its own byte shape (NUL count, BOM bytes, length parity)
#   before any behavior assertion, so a fixture edit cannot quietly turn a case
#   vacuous. A plain-UTF-8 control probe gates the sink cases: on a host where the
#   baseline sink does not block (no registry, rules unresolved), they SKIP as
#   UNPROVEN rather than mis-reporting the transcode.

# unit is two non-zero bytes), so WP0.1 passes it through and semgrep scans it
# undecoded. This is the plan's DOCUMENTED residue (review R3-2), bounded to

# the only tightening that would catch it there also breaks Latin-1 passthrough.
# The case pins the boundary so a future "fix" that silently widens or narrows
# it shows up here.
#   THE RECEIPT HALF IS A MEASURED DISJUNCTION SINCE BL-200. The passthrough
#   facts are HARD pins (no transcode, no block, commit lands). What the receipt
#   then says depends on whether the HOST semgrep emits its syntax-error warning
#   while chewing the undecoded bytes: where it does (measured on 1.157.0), the
#   BL-200 detector forfeits the receipt and the residue no longer buys an
#   unearned [OK] — a strict narrowing, best-effort by BL-200's own terms; where
#   it stays silent, the pre-BL-200 receipt shape stands, which is the residue

# commit still LANDS (blocking was explicitly not chosen). BL-187: the
# per-rule budget is POLICY now — `--timeout=30` on the shipped invocation —
# and the old skip-shaped timeout proofs are re-armed via a BUDGET-SHRUNK
# mutant (30→1s) so the detector clause is provable on EVERY host instead of
# only hosts slow enough to blow a 30s budget.

# _mut_env <src> <dst> <old> <new> <want>: literal replace via ENVIRON — the
# suite's older _mut_n passes literals through `awk -v`, which PROCESSES
# ESCAPES; the `--timeout=30 \` literal ends in a lone backslash, the exact
# BSD-vs-mawk/gawk divergence that broke a CI shard on PR #293. ENVIRON
# passes bytes untouched everywhere. Numeric `want` stays -v (safe).

# ── T-bl185-doc-mention: PROSE naming the directive is not a suppression ────
# Walk of 2026-08-02, ISSUE-018: committing a Markdown
# report whose sentences DISCUSS the directive produced a
# `type: "sast_suppression"` row naming that .md — the security-review ledger
# gained a false suppression event for a file that suppresses nothing, and
# every honest write-up about suppressions accretes another one. semgrep has
# no analyzer for Markdown/plain-text: a directive there cannot skip a line,
# so those file classes are out of the detector's scope. BOTH directions in
# ONE fixture: the .md must produce no row and must not be named, while the
# .ts staged in the SAME commit still forfeits the receipt and rows.

The pre-commit gate records every `nosemgrep` directive as an audited
observation. A `// nosem` comment suppresses the following line, so the
report has to name the directive it is reporting on.

    # UPPERCASE and .mdx siblings make the extension CASE-FOLD load-bearing:
    # a reviewer mutant that deleted the fold survived this case when the
    # fixture only carried lowercase `.md` (R-GATEUX-3b, 2026-08-02 review).
    # The uppercase file is NOT named README.MD, deliberately: mk_repo seeds a
    # tracked `README.md`, and on a case-INSENSITIVE filesystem (macOS APFS)
    # the two are ONE path — git stages the tracked lowercase name, the fold is
