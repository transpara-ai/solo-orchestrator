# Regression: scripts/check-phase-gate.sh used the antipattern
#   var=$(cmd_that_may_exit_nonzero || echo "0")
# where `cmd_that_may_exit_nonzero` was `grep -c` (which exits 1 on zero
# matches). When the grep exited 1 it had already printed "0\n", so the
# `||` appended a second "0" — the variable then held the two-line
# string "0\n0". Subsequent `[ "$var" -lt N ]` errored with
# "integer expression expected" and (under set -euo pipefail) the
# arithmetic test returned non-zero, sending control to the OK branch
# at five sites and silently bypassing hard gates.
#
# The most severe site was the Pre-Phase 0 organizational pre-condition
# gate (line ~203): when APPROVAL_LOG.md had the "Pre-Phase 0" section
# header but ZERO ISO dates in it, the script printed
#   [OK] Pre-Phase 0 pre-conditions recorded (0
#   0 entries)
# instead of WARNing about a missing pre-condition gate.
#
# Fix: capture into a temp var, then sanitize via the case-statement
# pattern already in scripts/process-checklist.sh:45-46
#   case "$var" in ''|*[!0-9]*) var=0 ;; esac
# so the arithmetic always sees a single non-negative integer.
