# tests/test-delta-wp4-close-rubric.sh — Delta Track WP4.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §5.2 (the per-class gate
# table and its token vocabulary), §5.3 (the brief's done-observable section IS
# the close review's rubric — "the close gate reads the brief's criteria
# section and refuses an unchecked box"), §4.2 (the two honest limits: the
# close-time re-derivation RATCHETS and never lowers, and a raise APPENDS
# gates), §6.2 (the brief's five sections; done-observable is the rubric),
# §7.1 (gates_required / gates_completed, the append-only `closed` tail, the
# single-writer rule), §7.2 (every gate list and threshold is READ FROM
# POLICY), §11-WP4.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1,
# WP2 and WP3 precedent.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES, NEVER LABELS
#
# Every assertion below reads a process EXIT CODE, a JSON value read back off
# disk, or a byte-level md5 / whole-tree manifest. None reads a printed
# [OK]/[WARN]/[FAIL] banner. CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is exactly that the label
# and the exit predicate can disagree. The close flow has SIX distinct refusal
# outcomes and they are told apart by their codes:
#
#     6   nothing is open to close
#     7   required gates are still outstanding
#     8   the brief's rubric has an unchecked (or unreadable) criterion
#     9   an unknown gate token — a configuration error, failing CLOSED
#    10   the close-time re-measurement RAISED an attribute and added
#         obligations, so the close refuses on the LARGER checklist
#
# Codes 7 and 9 are deliberately different, and U2 is the case that needs the
# difference: a project that retunes `attribute_toggles` to a token the
# framework has never heard of must get "you still owe this" (7) and never
# "this is not a gate" (9). A suite that asserted "the close was refused" could
# not tell those two apart, and the wrong one of them is a project locked out
# of closing its own deltas.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, AND WHICH MUTANT EACH ROW KILLS
#
#   C — THE PER-CLASS GATE REFUSAL (§5.2)
#     C1  a FEATURE with brief_review outstanding is refused (7), named  KILLS m5
#     C2  a FIX with repro_test_red_first outstanding is refused (7), named
#     C3  a close with nothing open is refused (6) and creates nothing
#     C4  every gate complete => the close proceeds (rc 0). Without this the
#         refusals could be a script that always refuses, which is not a gate
#
#   K — --complete-gate, AND ITS HONEST NOTE
#     K1  a listed token is recorded, idempotently; a token this delta does not
#         owe is an invocation error (2) that writes nothing; nothing open is 6
#     K2  the surface does not OVERCLAIM: it says the gate is ATTESTED and
#         names the two mechanical exceptions this WP actually makes real
#
#   W — THE ATOMIC CLOSE WRITE (§7.1, and carry-forward (a))
#     W1  ONE seam write: `closed` grows by exactly one AND the slot nulls,
#         with class / severity / closed_at / attributes / gates_completed
#         archived on the row                                            KILLS m3
#     W2  THE ID-REUSE PIN: the next open takes DELTA-002, because the closed
#         row is what `_next_id` reads. A close that nulls without appending
#         hands the NEXT delta the id of the one just closed
#     W3  the close is NOT era-guarded. §10.1 puts the era refusal at OPEN; an
#         open delta at phase < 4 is already the inconsistency validate.sh
#         reports, and closing it is the only way to restore the invariant
#
#   X — THE CLOSE-TIME RE-DERIVATION AND ITS RATCHET (§4.2)
#     X1  a delta opened small/feature-local whose REAL diff at close crosses
#         into evolution/core raises both attributes, APPENDS the newly toggled
#         gates, and refuses (10) naming them                            KILLS m1
#     X2  the ratchet is not a dead end: completing the new obligations (and
#         satisfying the brief the ratchet just demanded) closes the delta
#     X3  RATCHET DIRECTION: a shrunken diff does NOT lower a confirmed
#         attribute, and removes no gate
#
#   B — THE RUBRIC BIND (§5.3)
#     B1  a brief with one unchecked box refuses the close (8) and NAMES the
#         criterion                                                      KILLS m2
#     B2  all boxes checked => the close proceeds
#     B3  a class with no `brief` gate is unaffected — it closes with no
#         docs/deltas directory in the tree at all
#     B4  FAIL-CLOSED, four ways: no brief file; no Done-observable section;
#         a section with zero checkboxes; a malformed marker. A rubric that
#         cannot be read is not a rubric that passed
#
#   U — THE GATE-TOKEN VOCABULARY (§5.2)
#     U1  an unknown token in gates_required is a config error (9) even when it
#         is also marked complete — it fails CLOSED                      KILLS m4
#     U2  and the vocabulary is POLICY-DERIVED, not a hardcoded table: a project
#         that retunes attribute_toggles to `second_reviewer` gets 7, not 9,
#         and closes once it completes it
#
#   N — REFUSAL RESIDUE (the WP3 standard, inherited verbatim)
#     N1  every refused close leaves the tree EXACTLY as it found it — asserted
#         as a whole-tree `find` manifest with a per-file md5, not against one
#         expected filename
#
#   R — R-WP3-3: THE SEAM-LEVEL REPLACEMENT REFUSAL (carry-forward (b), taken)
#     R1  --delta-state-update REPLACING an open active_delta with a different
#         id is refused at the SEAM, file byte-identical                 KILLS m6
#     R2  and the atom refuses REPLACEMENT, not MUTATION: the same delta's
#         gates_completed append still writes. Without R2 the atom could be a
#         blanket non-null->non-null refusal, which would break --complete-gate
#         and the ratchet write — both of which are exactly that shape
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# COUNTERFACTUAL DISCIPLINE — how the mutations below are built
#
# Inherited from tests/test-delta-wp3-era-classify.sh and unchanged, because it
# is what makes a mutation proof a proof:
#
#   • ANCHORED SINGLE-SITE addresses. Every marker is pinned to END-OF-LINE
#     (`/# DELTA-CLOSE-RATCHET$/`), never a bare substring — WP2's suite records
#     what over-matching costs: an unanchored `/SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED/` also matches
#     SHAPE-ATOM-CLOSED-ROWS and credits one RED to two atoms.
#   • THREE PROPERTIES ASSERTED BEFORE THE RESULT IS BELIEVED: the marker
#     resolves to EXACTLY ONE line in the pristine file; the mutant DIFFERS from
#     it; and EXACTLY ONE LINE changed (one `<` and one `>`).
#   • MODE-PRESERVING harness. `_sed_inplace` reads each file's mode and puts it
#     back; the obvious `chmod +x` spelling silently turns a sourced 0644 lib
#     into 0755 and the mode rides along in the next commit.
#   • FRESH-FIXTURE ISOLATION. Every mutation builds its own mktemp project, and
#     — this is the part that bites in a close flow — the fixture must reach the
#     guard under test. m2's brief-rubric fixture must have every gate COMPLETE,
#     or the outstanding-gates refusal fires two guards earlier and the mutant
#     looks pinned when it is not. m4's fixture must mark the unknown token
#     COMPLETE for the same reason.
#   • STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATORS WHERE THE EXPECTED RESULT IS AN ABSENCE. Four of
#     the six mutants below expect "the refusal did not happen", which is the
#     same answer a fixture that never reached the guard would give. Each of
#     those rows therefore also asserts a POSITIVE consequence of the mutation
#     having landed — the closed row's attributes are still the SMALL ones while
#     the real diff in the same fixture measures evolution (m1); the brief in
#     the mutant's own tree still carries an unchecked box (m2); the next id is
#     REUSED (m3); the closed row's gates_completed lacks the gate that was
#     outstanding (m5) — and every one of them is measured against the PRISTINE
#     tree run on an identical fixture in the same case.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# HERMETICITY: every fixture is a mktemp -d project carrying NO init.sh and NO
# templates/generated, so guard_not_in_framework sees a project and not the
# framework. Git fixtures configure an identity and unset GITHUB_BASE_REF. No
# remote is ever created; nothing reaches the network; nothing is written inside
# the checkout. bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml
# `unit-shard` list. Its executed lines never name init.sh.

# The first cut of this section claimed that "every PURE refusal leaves the tree

# write. An adversarial review REFUTED the generalization by execution, and it
# was right: the ratchet writes whenever the re-measure RAISES an attribute,

# gates are already on the list — a SILENT RAISE — records itself and then falls
# through to the exit-7 or exit-8 refusal. So the true doctrine is not about
# which exit code you got; it is about whether a raise happened:
#
#   6 and 9   ALWAYS whole-tree pristine. 6 returns before anything is measured
#             and 9 runs BEFORE the ratchet, deliberately (see delta.sh) — which

# ── N3 / N4: THE SILENT-RAISE COMPOSITE — a refusal that is NOT rc 10 and
#             STILL carries the ratchet record ────────────────────────────────
# THE CASE THE FIRST CUT OF THIS SUITE DID NOT BUILD, and the one an adversarial
# review found by execution. The ratchet write is gated on "an attribute rose";
# the rc-10 refusal is gated on "and a gate was appended". Those two conditions
# are NOT the same, and every attribute raise that toggles nothing falls through
# the gap: the record is updated and then a LATER refusal returns.
#
# There are exactly two ways to raise without appending, and both are built:
#   N3  a level raise into a bracket that toggles nothing. Only
#       `level: evolution` carries a toggle (§5.2), so small -> significant is
#       structurally silent — it can never append.
#   N4  a raise whose toggled gate is ALREADY on the list. `risk: core` toggles
#       brief_review, which a feature already carries, so the append set is
#       empty by set arithmetic rather than by policy.
# Two different mechanisms reaching the same state; pinning one would have left
# the other free to drift.
#
# Each asserts FOUR things, and the last two are what make it a bound rather
# than an observation: the raise LANDED, gates_required did NOT grow (which is
# what distinguishes this from X1 and is the reason the exit code is 7/8 and not
# 10), no file outside the state document moved, and inside it nothing but
# attributes / gates_required / ratcheted_at changed. Plus IDEMPOTENCE on N3: a
# second close re-measures to the same bracket and writes nothing at all, so the
