# BL-166 + BL-158 (residuals wave, Dogfood-4 S3): scripts/check-phase-gate.sh
# --gate <name> must scope its exit code / summary count to the NAMED gate's
# checks and must label the FORCED phase distinctly.
#
# BL-166 (gate semantics): `--gate phase_2_to_3` forces current_phase=3 so the
# 2→3 gate's checks fire, but the Phase 3→4 readiness blocks are guarded by
# `current_phase -ge 3` — the SAME threshold — so they fired too. A project that
# legitimately clears every 2→3 requirement still exited 1 with "N
# inconsistency(ies) — blocking", every one a not-yet-creatable 3→4 deliverable
# (HANDOFF.md, sbom.json, docs/test-results/, review manifest, …). The fix
# (# BL-166-GATE-SCOPE) confines the count to the named gate: when --gate names a
# gate whose TARGET is below 4, the 3→4 readiness region is announced as ONE
# non-counted [NEXT] line and its block-counting checks do not run.
#
# KNOWN CARVE-OUT ON BL-166's CONTRACT — recorded here so it is discoverable
# from BL-166's own side, not only from the arm that takes it. The brownfield
# adoption arm in check-phase-gate.sh (`# BF-ADOPT-GATE-BEGIN`) is deliberately
# NOT fenced by `skip_later_gate`: the adoption record is a PRECONDITION of
# every arm that reads the adoption flag rather than any one gate's check, so a
# scoped run passing while that record was silently lost would be the same
# silence under a narrower heading. Measured harmless when the stamp is intact —
# a scoped `--gate phase_1_to_2` run on an adopted fixture and on an unadopted
# control produce the SAME issue count, the only difference being one cosmetic
# `[OK] Adoption stamp present and intact` line. It counts an issue only when
# the committed manifest records an adoption the working copy has lost.
#
# BL-158 (header label): under a --gate override the header printed
# "Current phase: <forced>" — reading like recorded state on an audit trail even
# when phase-state.json records a different phase. The fix (# BL-158-GATE-LABEL)
# prints "Checking gate: <name> (as-if phase <forced>; recorded current_phase:
# <recorded>)" under --gate, and leaves the bare header unchanged.
#
# Cases:
#   (a) --gate phase_2_to_3 on a project meeting 2→3 with NO 3→4 deliverables
#       → exit 0 (RED against pre-fix code = exit 1).
#   (b) --gate phase_2_to_3 on a project FAILING a real 2→3 requirement
#       (FEATURES.md removed) → still exit 1 (named-gate enforcement intact).
#   (c) --gate phase_0_to_1 while phase-state records current_phase=0 → header
#       shows the distinct "as-if" label and NOT "Current phase: 1" (BL-158).
#   (d) A bare run (no --gate) is byte-unchanged: exit + "Current phase:" header,
#       and NO [NEXT] readiness line.
#   (e) T-mutation: neutering the `skip_later_gate=1` decision line in a copy of
#       the script re-includes the 3→4 checks in the --gate count → (a) flips to
#       exit 1.

# Product Manifesto

## 1. Vision
We build a widget tracker for small teams.

## 2. Problem
Teams lose track of their widgets across spreadsheets.

## 3. Users
Small team leads who coordinate shared inventory.

## 4. Solution
A simple web application with create, list, and delete.

## 5. Scope
MVP delivers create, list, and delete of widget records.

## 6. Success Metrics
At least ten weekly active users within one month.

## 7. Risks
Adoption risk, mitigated by a guided onboarding flow.

## 8. Timeline
Ship the MVP within six weeks of kickoff.

## Appendix B: Competency Matrix
The founder covers product and engineering competencies.

## Appendix D: Market Signal & Go/No-Go Evidence
Interviewed five leads; a GO decision was recorded early.
