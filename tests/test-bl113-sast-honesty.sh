# tests/test-bl113-sast-honesty.sh — BL-113 AGGREGATOR (walk findings F14 + F15).
#
# TWO defects, one credibility story:
#
#   F14 — a freshly-scaffolded project FAILED the framework's OWN Phase-3 SAST.
#         `semgrep --config auto` flagged 6 WARNINGs, ALL in framework-shipped
#         files (5 mutable GitHub-Action tags in the generated
#         .github/workflows/{ci,release}.yml + 1 IFS-tamper in
#         scripts/check-versions.sh) and ZERO in the app's own src/. A scanner
#         FAIL is NOT attestable (only a SKIP is) — so an honest operator could
#         not clear Phase 3 without editing framework-generated files.
#
#   F15 — and the gate then LAUNDERED that FAIL. Whenever the tree is dirty (the
#         NORMAL state while authoring Phase-3 artifacts) the 3→4 gate's BL-082
#         staleness check autoruns the driver with `--offline`, which downgraded
#         semgrep/license/snyk/zap to SKIP. The operator saw "scanner
#         unavailable", attested the SKIP in good faith, and passed — never
#         learning that a REAL scan FAILs.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES
#   T-scaffold-scan-clean   REAL init.sh scaffold → REAL `semgrep --config auto`
#                           → ZERO framework-origin findings. (SKIPs loudly if
#                           semgrep is not installed.)
#   T-no-launder-dirty-tree A dirty tree + a prior REAL semgrep FAIL → the 3→4
#                           gate does NOT present a fresh attestable SKIP. Both
#                           BL-113 defences are asserted on the operator-visible
#                           wording. Hermetic: needs no semgrep binary (the
#                           carry-forward arm) and uses a PATH stub (the
#                           tool-installed refusal arm).
#   T-offline-still-usable  Genuinely no tool + no prior real FAIL → an honest
#                           attestable SKIP, and the gate's Phase-3 validation
#                           arm still passes. The framework MUST work offline.
#   T-mutation-no-launder   Neuter the `# BL-113-NO-LAUNDER` decision bodies
#                           (marker intact) → T-no-launder goes RED; restore →
#                           GREEN.
#   T-mutation-action-pin   Revert ONE action pin to a mutable tag in a scratch
#                           scaffold → T-scaffold-scan-clean goes RED.
#
# AGGREGATOR: runs the REAL init.sh, so it is registered ONLY in
# tests/full-project-test-suite.sh (SUITE_SKIP_AGGREGATORS-gated) and NEVER in
# the tests.yml unit fast lane.
#
# Hermetic: mktemp scratch, --no-remote-creation, GITHUB_BASE_REF unset, local
# git identity in every fixture repo. bash-3.2 safe (no ${var,,}, no declare -A,
# no ((x++)) under set -e).

# HARNESS HOOKS (used ONLY by tests/test-bl099-guard-coverage.sh; a bare run of
# this file ignores both):
#   BL113_SCRIPTS_OVERRIDE=<dir>  after scaffolding, replace the scaffold's copies
#                                 of run-phase3-validation.sh + check-phase-gate.sh
#                                 with the ones in <dir>, so the guard harness can
#                                 drive this suite against a NEUTERED script.
#   BL113_ONLY=no-launder         run only the F15 anti-laundering arms (skip the
#                                 semgrep scaffold scan and the in-file mutation
#                                 arms) — keeps the harness's 2-runs-per-row cost
#                                 down and pins the assertion to the guard.

# — RED arm (a): DRIVER carry-forward, no semgrep on PATH.
#
# BL-173 re-aim: pin on the LAUNDERING-SPECIFIC delta, NOT the overall gate
# verdict. On the pristine driver the marked `# BL-113-NO-LAUNDER` lines promote
# the offline SKIP of a prior-REAL-FAIL scanner back to FAIL (proven load-bearing
# by T-no-launder-dirty-tree (a) above, which on the SAME fixture asserts the
# gate shows 'last real result: FAIL' AND the regenerated summary records semgrep
# FAIL). Neutering those marked driver lines removes the promotion, so the
# carry-forward FAIL degrades into the fresh SKIP the marker exists to prevent —
# the exact laundering. Assert that degradation two ways, both the inverse of the
# GREEN (a) case: (1) the regenerated offline summary now records semgrep-full-
# tree SKIP (was FAIL when pristine — the DRIVER-side laundering, deterministic
# and independent of attestation state), and (2) the gate no longer surfaces the
# '[STALE — last real result: FAIL]' carry-forward line. The OLD assertion looked
# for 'validation scans clean', which ADDITIONALLY required the regenerated SKIP
# to be attested — an environment-sensitive signal that does NOT hold here (the
# regenerated SKIP comes up un-attested), so the case failed for an unrelated
# reason and was never pinned to the marked lines. Mirrors RED(b)'s "the guarded
# signal is gone once the marked line is neutered" shape.
