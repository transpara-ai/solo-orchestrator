# tests/test-delta-wp8-intake.sh — Delta Track WP8.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §6.1 (the three creation
# paths, all converging on the SAME three writes — brief file, ledger row,
# state activation — with exactly one writer for the third), §6.2 (the brief's
# five sections, and "the done-observable section IS the close review's
# rubric"), §6.3 (identity `docs/deltas/DELTA-NNN-slug.md`, `max(existing)+1`,
# and the HARD constraint that the BUGS.md table format is parsed by scripts so
# the delta link rides the EXISTING `Fix Reference` column), §10.4 (the bridge:
# the manifesto's § 6 Post-MVP Backlog is READ as candidates, never moved),
# §10.5 (the ambient branch: resume.sh's fourth branch, ahead of the classic
# one), §5.2 (`audit_row_at_open`), §11-WP8.
#
# Plus Karl's two decisions of 2026-08-09 that landed in this work package:
#   D1  SHIP THE DELTA MODULE. init.sh carried the string `delta` zero times,
#       so the entire track reached no generated project. The copy list, the
#       chmod split (libs get none, entry scripts do) and the Class-T template
#       are asserted here, and the source-closure invariant is re-run because a
#       copy-list change MOVES the derived shipped set.
#   D3  `audit_row_at_open` WRITES A REAL BUGS.md ROW, in addition to WP5's
#       state-document stamp. The reviewer's evidence: the stamp survives
#       neither an abandoned hotfix nor a lost state file, so the audit trace it
#       promises does not persist. WP5's record is NOT removed and its tests are
#       NOT disturbed — this suite asserts BOTH are written.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh. The design-doc path above is the citation, per
# the WP1–WP7 precedent.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES, NEVER LABELS
#
# CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap: the printed label and the exit predicate can
# disagree. Every refusal below is asserted on the process EXIT CODE, on JSON
# read back off disk, or on a byte-level md5 — never on a banner. The codes this
# suite depends on are delta.sh's published set:
#     2   invocation error (a bad `--slug`, a bad `--via`, two briefs claiming
#         one id)
#     8   the brief's rubric has an unchecked criterion
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE SLUG IS WHERE A USER STRING BECOMES A FILESYSTEM PATH
#
# WP3's adversarial review recorded `--slug ../../../etc/cron.d/evil` stored
# VERBATIM in the state document. WP3 only ever wrote it to JSON; WP8 is the
# work package that turns it into `docs/deltas/<slug>.md`, so the refusal lands
# here and is pinned here — in BOTH directions. S1 proves the traversal is
# refused and that NOTHING was written anywhere in the tree (a refusal that
# leaves a file behind is not a refusal). S3 proves the sanitiser is not merely
# a blanket "reject anything unusual": an ordinary messy human slug still opens,
# and lands on a basename made only of [a-z0-9-].
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MUTATIONS — the standard this wave settled on, all of it, every mutant
#
#   • the marker is ANCHORED to end-of-line (`…$`), so a sed cannot land in the
#     middle of a continuation;
#   • `sites == 1` is asserted — a marker that matches twice mutates two places
#     and proves nothing about either;
#   • EXACTLY ONE LINE CHANGED is asserted (`diff | grep -c '^[<>]'` == 2);
#   • EVERY mutant additionally asserts `bash -n`. This is not ceremony: a
#     mutation that landed mid-continuation earlier in this wave produced a
#     MANGLED PARSE whose crash read as "the guard caught it". A mutant that
#     does not parse has not tested anything;
#   • the harness is MODE-PRESERVING (`stat -c || stat -f`, the house GNU-first
#     pattern) — a mutant that silently drops the exec bit fails for the wrong
#     reason;
#   • FRESH-FIXTURE ISOLATION: every mutant gets its own scripts tree AND its
#     own project, built from scratch;
#   • STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATORS where the expected result is an ABSENCE. m1's
#     "the manifesto was not modified" is an absence, so the killed/survived
#     decision reads an md5, not a message;
#   • no fixture temp dir derives its uniqueness from a counter inside a command
#     substitution — that produced cross-suite fixture collisions earlier in
#     this wave. Every directory here is either `mktemp -d` or a NAMED
#     subdirectory of one.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LANE: BOTH. This suite reads the scaffolder statically (it never runs it), so
# it is fast and belongs in the fast lane. The scaffolder's basename is spelled
# SPLIT below for exactly the reason tests/test-delta-severability.sh spells it
# split — `# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE` exempts any test whose executed lines
# NAME init.sh, and an exempt fast test quietly stops running in PR CI. The
# split is documented rather than hidden, and the file is registered in
# tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml `unit-shard` list.

#     [ -e "$PS/../../../etc" ] && [ -e "$PS/../../../etc/cron.d" ]
# with $PS one level under `mktemp -d`. On this laptop `mktemp -d` yields
# /var/folders/<hash>/<hash>/T/tmp.XXXX, so `../../..` lands deep inside
# /var/folders and the probe was ALWAYS false. On a GitHub runner `mktemp -d`
# yields /tmp/tmp.XXXX, so `../../..` IS `/` — and Ubuntu ships /etc/cron.d. The
# probe therefore went TRUE on CI with the product having written nothing at
# all, and it was unfalsifiable in BOTH directions: it could fire with no write,
# and on macOS it could not fire even if a real write had happened. A check that
# reads the host is not a check.
#
# THE FIX IS TO MAKE THE TRAVERSAL LAND SOMEWHERE MEASURABLE. The project sits
# three levels below a private sandbox root, so `../../../etc` resolves to
# $S1_SB/etc on EVERY host, and the manifest covers the WHOLE sandbox rather
# than just the project — so a write anywhere the traversal could reach shows up
# as a changed line instead of as an existence test nobody can trust.

# ── SH7 — THE SMUGGLING BATTERY (review R-WP8-1 / R-WP8-2) ─────────────────
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS ROW TESTED ONE CASE AND GAVE FALSE CONFIDENCE. It
# injected a STANDALONE `source` (case B below), watched it fail, and concluded
# "the fence cannot launder a real dependency edge". The fence could: the check
# read only a line's LEADING TOKEN, so
#     cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh" scripts/lib/ ; source "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/lib/delta-state.sh"
# was "installation" and the WHOLE line — the `source` with it — was exempted.
# That passed the lint at rc 0 and rode straight through the PR-blocking
# `delta-boundary-lint` job; the severability suite could not see it either,
# because the revert drops the fence wholesale. An adversarial review found it
# by execution.
#
# So this is a BATTERY, and every row asserts the RIGHT REASON, not merely a
# non-zero exit — a fixture that reds for an unrelated reason is a row that
# measures nothing. The two families are deliberately separated:
#   chaining      a second command riding on an installation line
#   grammar       a line that is not an installation statement at all
# and case L is the one that matters most for R-WP8-2: a PERFECTLY CLEAN cp in
# an extra fence, which no I1 arm can see and which only the fence-count bound
# catches. Without L that bound could rot untested behind the chaining check.
