#
# Coverage for BL-033: templates/tool-matrix/*.json entries with
# multi-stage `install_cmd` strings are migrated to a structured
# `install_cmds` array shape so per-stage failure surfaces cleanly
# and consumers can iterate stages instead of dumping the whole
# string into `bash -c "cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3"`.
#
# Reader contract (scripts/resolve-tools.sh):
#   1. Legacy string value at install.<key> → resolver output emits
#      install_cmd = string AND install_cmds = [string].
#   2. Array of strings at install.<key> → resolver output emits
#      install_cmds = the array AND install_cmd = array joined with
#      " && " (back-compat for legacy consumers reading the singular
#      field).
#   3. Object shape at install.<key> that contains BOTH `install_cmd`
#      and `install_cmds` → reader EXITS NONZERO with a clear error
#      identifying the offending key (mutually-exclusive shape).
#   4. Empty array or non-string array elements → reader exits nonzero
#      with a diagnostic.
#
# Consumer contract (bash script that iterates install_cmds):
#   T-array-fail-fast — stage-1 nonzero exit MUST prevent stage-2 from
#   executing. This is the fail-fast diagnosis property BL-033 requires
#   to make multi-stage installs debuggable.
#
# Mutation: revert the array-reader arm of scripts/resolve-tools.sh
# (delete the `elif ($v | type) == "array"` branch). Under the mutant,
# T-array-happy fails RED (install_cmds field missing/empty; joined
# install_cmd blank).
#
# Test harness conventions: mirrors tests/test-bl046-helpers-split.sh
# — self-contained (no init.sh setup), each scenario in an isolated
# tmpdir, PASS/FAIL counters + exit status.

# BL-135-RESOLVER-PROBE-STUB — pin the resolver's package-manager probe
# so this harness is host-independent.
#
# scripts/resolve-tools.sh builds its install-key priority list by
# probing the REAL HOST (`command -v brew`, `command -v npm`, … — the
# HAS_BREW/HAS_NPM block). That is CORRECT product behaviour: a Mac with
# no Homebrew must be handed `darwin_manual`, not brew commands it cannot
# run. So the product is left alone and the HARNESS is pinned instead.
# Every `_run_resolver` scenario below asserts on a `darwin_brew` install
# key; on a host without Homebrew (every ubuntu-latest CI runner) that
# key is silently dropped from the priority list and 6 of the 8 scenarios
# collapse — measured 8/8 with brew present, 2/8 with brew hidden. That
# is the CI-vs-local divergence BL-135 tracked; it was never a flake.
#
# Only brew and npm are stubbed. apt/dnf/pacman gate the `linux_*` keys,
# which this harness never reaches because `_run_resolver` always passes
# `--dev-os darwin`; stubbing brew+npm makes the resolver's key list
# exactly `darwin_brew,darwin_manual,npm,manual` on EVERY host. If a
# scenario is ever added that passes `--dev-os linux`, it MUST extend
# this stub set or the harness becomes host-dependent again.
#
# The resolver only ever runs `command -v` against these names — nothing
# is executed — so an empty executable file is sufficient.
