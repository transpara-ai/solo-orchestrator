# BL-184-CHILD-EVIDENCE — the child-suite delegate runner
# ================================================================
# Every delegate in this file used to be invoked as
#     if bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/<child>" >/dev/null 2>&1; then pass ...; else fail ...
# which destroyed the diagnostic at the moment of capture. A child that fails
# ONLY in CI produced exactly one line — "<child> FAILED (run for details)" —
# and "run for details" was unactionable precisely BECAUSE the failure did not
# reproduce locally. That catch-22 is why BL-135 sat open from 2026-07-18 to
# 2026-07-26 across two ~3h full-lane runs with zero root-cause progress.
#
# run_child_suite captures combined stdout+stderr and, ON FAILURE ONLY, replays
# a bounded excerpt inline so the failing case NAME reaches the CI log.
#
#   run_child_suite <path-relative-to-repo-root> <pass-label> [fail-label] [-- <child-arg>...]
#
# CONTRACT — read this before editing:
#   * ALWAYS returns 0. The suite runs under `set -euo pipefail` and calls this
#     as a bare statement, so any non-zero return would abort the entire run at
#     the first red child. Failure accounting stays with fail(); the suite still
#     ends `exit $FAIL`. This preserves the exit-code semantics of the if/else
#     blocks it replaces exactly.
#   * NOTHING is printed on success — pass() emits byte-identical text to the
#     pre-BL-184 shape, so anything grepping those labels is unaffected, and a
#     chatty-but-green child adds zero bytes to the log (its output goes to the
#     scratch file, never to stdout).
#   * fail-label defaults to "<path> FAILED (run for details)" — the exact
#     string 149 of the 177 converted call sites already used verbatim.
#   * Replay goes through awk/printf, never `echo -e`: child output is
#     arbitrary text and `echo -e` would eat backslash escapes inside it.
#   * Every replayed line carries the "    | " prefix so a child's own [FAIL]
#     lines can never be misread as one of THIS suite's [FAIL] lines.
#
# BOUNDS — both overridable per-run for local debugging:
#   SUITE_CHILD_TAIL_LINES=40 — sampled on this repo 2026-07-26: unit-style
#     children emit 8/10/18/18/30/53 lines total (test-check-gate,
#     -bl169-gitignore-anchor, -bl033-install-cmds-shape, -bl184-child-suite-
#     evidence, -lint-tests-registered), so 40 replays the median child WHOLE
#     and covers the closing cases plus the "Results: N passed, M failed" tally
#     of the larger ones. The heavy aggregator children (edge-cases-*,
#     host-drivers/run-all.sh, the BL-052 trio) run well past it — that is what
#     SUITE_CHILD_MARKER_LINES is for.
#     Log-volume ceiling is ~70 lines per RED child; a realistic bad run (<10
#     red children) adds under 700 lines to a full-lane log already running to
#     tens of thousands, and the pathological all-177-red run is a total loss
#     whose log size is not the operative problem.
#   SUITE_CHILD_MARKER_LINES=25 — a pure tail MISSES the failing case whenever a
#     child fails EARLY and passes late, which is the common shape for the
#     over-bound children. So for over-bound output the child's own
#     failure-marker lines are digested FIRST, then the tail. Pinned by
#     tests/test-bl184-child-suite-evidence.sh T2/T3.

# prompt, even with --project-dir pointing at a benign external path. Only
# --dry-run worked, and no test ever ran the README's literal sequence (E8b
# above hit the same wall; BL-041 reordered preflight-before-guard to get the
# TEST past it). Karl's 2026-07-29 contract: running from the clone is the
# SUPPORTED flow; a bare --project-dir creates the project BESIDE the clone
# (anchor = SCRIPT_DIR/.., not the cwd); writing onto the framework — its root,
# anything inside it, or another clone — is still refused.
# Builds its own framework clone in a tempdir (init.sh needs its whole
# templates/scripts/docs tree beside it) and carries all seven mutation proofs
# in-suite. Invokes init.sh → aggregator lane only, not the tests.yml unit list.
# Deliberately NOT a fixed N/N label: T9 and M4 SKIP on case-sensitive
# filesystems (they exercise a case-variant path that is a genuinely different
# directory there), so the pass count differs by platform. A hardcoded count
# would read as a failure on one of the two. The child's own tally line reports
# `Skipped` explicitly, which is what makes those skips visible here — this

# Brownfield adoption WP3: tests/test-brownfield-wp3-adoption-arms.sh — the

# brownfield package that touches a gate. The `adopted` flag accessor,
# soif_adoption_stamp, the TDD pre-adoption exemption, and stamp acceptance in
# check-phase-gate.sh.
# EVERY VERDICT IS AN EXIT CODE. In check-phase-gate.sh the [WARN]/[FAIL] label
# is cosmetic and an exemption is the ABSENCE of an `issues` increment, so a
# test that greps a label proves nothing.
# The TDD arm is proved in BOTH DIRECTIONS and direction (ii) is the one that
# matters: neuter the exemption and a pre-adoption commit blocks; neuter the
# BOUND and a POST-adoption commit with no test passes — an unbounded exemption
# is a permanent TDD waiver wearing an adoption badge.
# T7 IS THE ATTACK BATTERY AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. The first cut of this WP
# shipped 19/19 green with a bound that everyday git defeated: the T-series
# never constructed a divergent history, and six of ten histories exempted a
# POST-adoption commit — a local rebase, a SQUASH MERGE (a GitHub default, and
# the worst: it exempts every subsequent mainline commit forever), an orphan
# branch, a cherry-pick, a second stamp, and a working-copy anchor tamper. All
# ten are pinned here, T1 stays as the control that a predicate which merely
# blocked everything would fail, and T8 proves EACH of the corrected bound's two
# conjuncts load-bearing separately — one conjunct proven only jointly can be
# dead code, and dead code here is a reopened hole. The stamp is proved
# additive against a foreign top-level key AND against all five §8.5
# existing-file writers run in sequence, each writer's jq filter pinned at
# sites==1 in its own shipped source so a changed writer fails loudly instead
# of leaving a stale copy under test. Every mutant is anchored at sites==1,
# line-counted at exactly one changed line, mode-preserving, run in a FRESH
# fixture, and asserted TO STILL PARSE — the first cut of one mutation landed
# mid-continuation of a two-line `if`, counted 2 changed lines, and proved a

# — the writer is in a different repository — so what is proved is that it is

# Brownfield adoption WP4: tests/test-brownfield-wp4-driver.sh — the DRIVER
# (scripts/adopt-project.sh), the scenario chooser, scenario placement and
# reverse intake.
# THREE PROPERTIES CARRY THE WEIGHT AND EACH IS PINNED TWICE.
# (1) The chooser is Karl's sentence VERBATIM and is a DECISION, not a
#     phrasing: pinned by STRING EQUALITY against a literal spelled
#     independently in the suite, again as a whole line of the real
#     transcript, and — because §4.2 explicitly rejects presenting a guess as
#     a default for the most consequential answer in the flow — by withholding
#     the answer and requiring the run to STOP rather than choose.
# (2) The floor rule is ONE-DIRECTIONAL: both directions are asserted (an
#     interview that lowers the placement does, one that raises it does not)
#     and the mutation neuters the floor so the SAME interview raises S2 from
#     2 to 4.
# (3) The state-creation order is phase-state -> intake -> manifest because
#     the failure directions are ASYMMETRIC. Every interruption point is
#     executed, and the safe row is asserted through BOTH of §8.4's surfaces —
#     the gate's exit code AND read_enforcement_level — never a label.
#     Reversing the order makes the unsafe row reachable: a manifest, no
#     phase-state, and a gate that skips entirely at rc 0.
# Data classification's non-skippability is asserted THROUGH THE GATE that
# makes it mechanical: the mutant completes a run without it and the resulting
# project then FAILS its own Phase 1->2 ZDR backstop, with a positive control
# so that failure cannot be vacuous. The TDD bound WP3 shipped is proved END TO
# END on the adopted project, running the project's OWN installed gate, and the
# blocked direction asserts exit 3 — the BL-072 TDD arm specifically — rather
# than merely non-zero. Mutants run against a scratch framework MIRROR, so a
# failure here can never leave this repository mutated. Never invokes the
# scaffolder (it copies init.sh into the mirror; it does not run it) -> both lanes.

# Brownfield adoption WP5b: tests/test-brownfield-wp5b-test-debt.sh — the
# TEST-DEBT LEDGER (.claude/test-debt.json) and its tier ratchet, which is
# kind (c)'s forward equivalent: the ordering of pre-adoption commits is not a
# re-runnable fact, so what is enforced instead is that the untested set may
# not GROW and that a ledgered file which is TOUCHED must leave the set.
# THE SECOND MUTATION DIRECTION IS THE POINT. Neutering an arm and watching
# the untested set grow silently is the obvious half. The other half — neuter
# the TIER FLOOR and watch the arm refuse a `no`-tier project — is the one
# that usually gets skipped, and a ratchet that blocks a poc_mode project is
# not a stricter ratchet, it is the shape that makes an operator disable the
# framework (the false-FAIL doctrine of BL-122/BL-149). Both directions are
# proved for BOTH arms: M1/M2 neuter the arms, M3/M4 neuter the floor and
# observe it through each arm's own fixture, M5 promotes the `light` row so
# the identical WARN becomes a block (the `[WARN]` trap, asserted as an exit
# code and never as a label).
# The tier read consumes read_enforcement_level and assert_choosable and
# RAISES ONLY, so `## BL-221:`'s live fail-open — `.deployment // "personal"`
# resolving an ABSENT key to the choosable tier — cannot lower anything; M6

# THE SECURITY HALF IS THE POINT. Archiving a `.git/hooks/` file promotes an
# UNTRACKED file into version control, so adoption can commit a credential that
# was never committed before. The suite plants a BASE32-valid AWS key in the
# fixture's pre-commit hook and asserts, IN THIS ORDER: that the plant is live
# and the scan found it (a dud plant makes every later assertion vacuous — the
# §6.5 lesson applied to a different surface); that the matching entry refuses
# to stage while its CLEAN SIBLING in the same archive still commits; and that
# the plant reaches zero bytes of the committed tree, the MANIFEST, the
# transcript and the ledger. Every absence has a positive control, including
# the `git grep HEAD` probe, which must find a token that IS committed.
# Three mutations: neuter the pre-staging scan (the secret is committed);
# suppress the re-add audit row (the file is still restored and nothing is

# WP8 writes are handled (BUGS.md and FEATURES.md) and the rows under test are

# ================================================================
# Registers the init-family and upgrade-family orphan tests that were

# (running ZERO times). Same BL-034 delegate discipline: each test invoked
# once, rc captured, contributes to pass()/fail(); no `|| true` wraps.
#
# Dispositions applied in this wiring pass (see the BL-035 orphan-triage
# report, 2026-07-06):
#   • DELETE   test-init-other-host-attestation.sh — fully superseded by the
#              already-registered test-init-fail-status-propagation.sh (same
#              --git-host other push-fail fixture + BL-064/BL-024 invariants);
#              its T2 dup'd init-non-interactive N9. File + bridge entry removed.
#   • RELOCATE test-github-free-tier-403.sh → tests/host-drivers/
#              github-free-tier-403.test.sh so tests/host-drivers/run-all.sh's
#              *.test.sh glob registers it (NOT this aggregator).
#   • MERGE    test-upgrade-personal-to-sponsored-poc.sh — unique T1
#              (personal→sponsored_poc R3-A guard + phase-state transition)
#              folded into tests/edge-cases-scripts.sh as E58b; T2/T3 dropped as
#              dups of E27/E60. File + bridge entry removed.
#   • DECOMPOSE test-upgrade-paths.sh — trimmed to its unique T4 (BL-004 flat→
#              per-host CI migration) / T5 (vendored-skills + private-poc +
#              manifesto) / T6 (POC-strip); the T1/T2/T3 tier-transition cases
#              were dropped as dups of tests/upgrade-path-tests.sh.
#   • N7 fix   test-init-non-interactive.sh N7 asserted personal+production →
#              exit 1, but the current product correctly ACCEPTS that combo
#              (production is valid for personal, baseline §2.5). N7 now pins

# host (writes to `.github/workflows/`), so it must source from
# `templates/pipelines/{ci,release}/github/`. If a future move relocates
# those templates again, the silent `[ -f ... ]` cp guards downstream
# would no-op without surfacing the breakage (the original BL-044 bug) —
# fail fast here so a future regression does not silently re-break TEST 4.
#
# Scope: GitHub-only — TEST_RUNS does not parameterize host. Adding
# gitlab/bitbucket coverage is BL-053 follow-up.

# === BUILD SHARED FIXTURE SCAFFOLD ONCE (BL-053) ===

# mkdir + cp*13 + chmod + git init cost — ~90% identical across combos.
# Only these files actually diverge per combo:
#   - .claude/phase-state.json      (project name, track, deployment, poc_mode)
#   - .claude/tool-preferences.json (resolver output for that combo)
#   - .github/workflows/ci.yml      (language-specific)
#   - .github/workflows/release.yml (platform-specific)
#   - docs/platform-modules/<t_platform>.md (platform-specific)
#   - PROJECT_INTAKE.md             (appends per-combo tooling section)
# Build the identical scaffold once, then `cp -R fixture/. project/` per
# combo and mutate only the divergent files. Source: BL-053 in
# Reports/2026-06-28-step4-dead-code-perf-eval.md §7 ROI #9 — fixture
# reuse targets the 30-40s waste from N repeated setup cycles.

# Cleanup: fixture template lives inside $TEST_DIR (already rm -rf'd
# at end of suite), and is also removed at the end of the TEST 4 loop
# so $TEST_DIR only contains the 7 simulated project dirs when TEST 5+

# ================================================================
# --- BL-052: wire previously-un-invoked aggregators ---
# ================================================================
# Three test AGGREGATORS shipped with substantial, largely-unique real
# tests but were never invoked by the master run or any CI gate, so
# every assertion inside them ran ZERO times (BL-052 / Step 4 ROI #8).
# Karl-approved Policy A: WIRE them into the master run, delete none.
# Each is a self-contained script that returns rc=0 iff all its own
# tests pass (edge-case-test-suite.sh ends `[ "$FAILED" -eq 0 ]`;
# known-bugs-test-suite.sh and upgrade-path-tests.sh end `exit $FAIL`),
# so the BL-034 delegate pattern applies verbatim: run once, capture rc,
# contribute to PASS/FAIL — no `|| true` wraps, nothing silenced.
#
# HERMETIC: all three are hermetic by construction — edge-case's init
# wrapper bakes in --no-remote-creation (BL-076), and upgrade-path's only
# git usage is a fake `https://example.com/fake.git` remote with no push.
#
# Runtime note: upgrade-path-tests.sh drives resolve-tools.sh across many
# track/phase combos and is slow (~18 min). That is orthogonal to
# correctness and tracked with the master suite's own runtime under
# BL-045 (TEST 1 matrix parallelization) / BL-077 (CI-runnability). It
# stays wired here regardless.
