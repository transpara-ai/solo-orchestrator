# tests/test-upgrade-interruption.sh — tests-upgrade-paths-4 regression.
#
# Audit finding: no test asserted what happens when scripts/upgrade-project.sh
# is interrupted by a fault injected mid-mutation (e.g., an unwritable
# APPROVAL_LOG.md). Sibling test-upgrade-project-atomic.sh covers the
# python3 KeyError + SIGINT vectors against the atomic snapshot/rollback
# block (PR #54/#57/#80), but the recoverable filesystem-permission
# vector — an APPROVAL_LOG.md that another tool has flagged read-only —
# was never exercised end-to-end. This test fault-injects `chmod 0444`
# on APPROVAL_LOG.md, runs --to-production --non-interactive, and
# asserts that the snapshot+rollback invariant holds:
#
#   * exit code is non-zero (the upgrade observably failed)
#   * the six staged operator files were restored to their pre-mutation
#     contents (rollback fired): phase-state.json, tool-preferences.json,
#     intake-progress.json, CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_INTAKE.md, and
#     APPROVAL_LOG.md must match the pre-run snapshot byte-for-byte
#   * git HEAD did NOT advance — no `chore(upgrade): ...` commit was
#     appended
#   * a pre-mutation snapshot dir exists under
#     .claude/upgrade-snapshots/ with >=1 child snapshot, proving the
#     run reached the snapshot phase before failing and the rollback
#     path (not an early-bail) was the path exercised
#
# This codifies current behavior without changing production code so
# any future regression that silently advances state under a partial
# write fault trips this test instead of corrupting an operator's
# project.

# BL-037 closure: the pre-fix T2 wrapped the snapshot-children
# assertion in `if [ -d "$TMPDIR_T/.claude/upgrade-snapshots" ]; then
# ... fi`. If `upgrade-project.sh`'s snapshot creation was completely
# broken and never created the dir, the conditional was skipped and

# mutation" invariant is precisely what T2 is supposed to guard —
# guarding it conditionally guards nothing. Per audit BL-037:
# "remove the `if [ -d ... ]` wrap on the snapshot dir assertion;
# make the dir's presence a hard requirement." This rewrite makes
# (a) directory presence and (b) at least one child snapshot HARD
# requirements identical to T1's assertion 4 — so a regression that
