# tests/test-delta-wp7-cut-release.sh — Delta Track WP7.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §9.1 (semver, decided by the
# TOOL — the class->bump map is retunable, the PRECEDENCE is machinery — and
# §13-R2's recorded cost of having no override), §9.2 (THE THREE REFUSALS AND
# THEIR ORDER, and the last line: "performs no write of any kind before all
# three pass"), §9.3 (promotion, and the tag format C7 forces), §8.2 (a major
# bump re-runs run-phase3-validation.sh in full BEFORE the tag is written),
# §8.3 (overdue AND unmeasurable are both refusals), §7.1 (`shipped_in` is
# recorded at cut time THROUGH THE SEAM), §3.1 (cut-release.sh is a
# DELTA-MODULE file despite its core-sounding name), §0.3-C7 (GitLab's
# version-strict release lanes — why the tag format is a constraint and not a
# preference), §0.3-C8 (`--finalize-phase 4` is a SECOND orphan and WP7 does
# NOT wire it), §11-WP7.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1
# through WP6 precedent. The grep-able `CUTREL-*` markers in the product are
# this suite's citation primitive and its mutation addresses.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE TWO PROPERTIES THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR
#
# 1. A REFUSED CUT LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND. §9.2's last line is not a nicety:
#    "a partially-cut release (changelog promoted, tag absent) is a worse state
#    than a refused one". Every refusal row below is asserted with a WHOLE-TREE
#    `find` + per-file md5 manifest taken before and after, plus a separate
#    count of the repository's tags — because a `git tag` leaves nothing in the
#    working tree at all and a file manifest alone cannot see one. Checking a
#    handful of expected filenames cannot see a file nobody thought to look
#    for; that is the WP4/WP5 standard and it is inherited here verbatim.
#
# 2. THE TAG IS EXACTLY `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. C7 measured the release lanes:
#    GitHub (4 templates) and Bitbucket (4) match `v*`; GitLab (4) matches
#    `/^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`. A `v1.2.0-rc1` therefore BUILDS on two hosts and
#    SILENTLY DOES NOTHING on the third — green on the host you tested, which
#    is the worst available failure mode. m2 emits exactly that suffix and this
#    suite must go RED for it.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES, NEVER LABELS
#
# Every verdict below is asserted on a process EXIT CODE, a file's BYTES, a
# whole-tree manifest, or a `git tag --list` count. None is asserted on a
# printed `[OK]`/`[WARN]`/`[FAIL]` banner. CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is that a
# label and an exit predicate can disagree — in check-phase-gate.sh two arms
# printing the SAME word have opposite gate outcomes — and BL-213's whole
# defect was a closing sentence that lied. Printed text is MEASURED for the
# reader in pass narratives; it is never the predicate.
#
# THE CONTRACT UNDER TEST (scripts/cut-release.sh):
#     0   the release was cut
#     2   invocation / environment error (bad flag, no git, no jq, no CHANGELOG)
#     3   REFUSAL 1 — a delta is open (§9.2)
#     4   REFUSAL 2 — an unfiled hotfix retro (§9.2)
#     5   REFUSAL 3 — cadence overdue OR unmeasurable (§9.2 + §8.3)
#     6   REFUSAL — the delta record exists and cannot be read (strict rc 3)
#     7   REFUSAL — there is no delta record at all (strict rc 4)
#     8   REFUSAL — nothing closed since the last tag (§9.1)
#     9   REFUSAL — a closed row's class maps to no bump (fail-closed)
#    10   REFUSAL — major bump, and the §8.2 revalidation did not pass
#    11   a write FAILED after every refusal passed — the cut is incomplete
#
# TWO CONSUMED CONTRACTS, NOT RE-SPELLED HERE:
#   • scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh — WP5's retro predicates and the seam's
#     `--delta-state-read-strict` rc 0/3/4. WP7 REFUSES ON BOTH 3 AND 4.
#   • scripts/check-maintenance.sh — WP6's 0 measured-current / 1 overdue /
#     2 unmeasurable. WP7 REFUSES ON BOTH 1 AND 2.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, AND WHICH MUTANT EACH ROW KILLS
#
#   R — THE THREE REFUSALS (§9.2), ALONE, IN COMBINATION, WRITING NOTHING
#     R1  open delta alone                      -> 3, tree + tags unmoved
#     R2  open hotfix retro alone               -> 4, names the delta, its
#         due_by and how overdue it is                            KILLS m1
#     R3  cadence OVERDUE (checker rc 1) alone  -> 5
#     R4  cadence UNMEASURABLE (checker rc 2)   -> 5, NOT a pass    KILLS m3
#     R5  all three at once -> 3: the CHEAPEST refusal speaks first (§9.2's
#         author-proposed order), and the tree is still untouched   KILLS m5
#     R6  refusals 2 and 3 together -> 4: the order holds with the first
#         refusal removed, which is what proves it is an ORDER and not an
#         accident of which check happens to be cheap
#     R7  the state file exists and is CORRUPT  -> 6 (strict read rc 3)
#     R8  there is no state file at all         -> 7 (strict read rc 4)
#     R9  nothing closed since the last tag     -> 8
#     R10 EVERY refusal above leaves the repository's TAG SET identical —
#         a `git tag` writes nothing into the working tree, so the file
#         manifest in R1-R9 is structurally blind to it
#     R11 a checker answering an UNDOCUMENTED code, and a checker that has
#         been DELETED (bash answers 127), are BOTH refusals    KILLS m6
#         — the row an adversarial review had to add for me. R3/R4 cover
#         only rc 1 and rc 2, so the `*)` arm that catches everything else
#         had no witness and its weakening mutant survived at 31/0. What it
#         costs to lose: `rm scripts/check-maintenance.sh` becomes cadence
#         forgiveness in one keystroke
#
#   S — SEMVER, DECIDED BY THE TOOL (§9.1)
#     S1  a feature + a fix        -> minor
#     S2  fixes only               -> patch
#     S3  a breaking marker        -> major, AND run-phase3-validation.sh is
#         actually INVOKED (§8.2), proven by a recording stub    KILLS m7
#     S4  major + a FAILING revalidation -> 10, and the tree is unmoved:
#         "before the tag is written" means before the CHANGELOG too
#     S5  the MAP is retunable: semver.fix = "minor" makes a fixes-only set
#         a minor release
#     S6  the PRECEDENCE is machinery: shuffling the `closed` rows cannot
#         change the answer, and no policy key can reorder it     KILLS m4
#     S7  no tag in the repository at all -> the base is 0.0.0
#     S8  a closed row whose class maps to no bump -> 9, fail-closed,
#         nothing written
#     S9  a class nobody could READ (`"class": {}` makes the token jq's
#         @tsv error while the id jq succeeds) -> 9, not a patch  KILLS m9
#
#   P — PROMOTION (§9.3)
#     P1  `## [Unreleased]` becomes `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`, and a FRESH
#         `## [Unreleased]` sits ABOVE it
#     P2  all EIGHT template categories survive, in template order, verbatim
#     P3  the promoted block's body is BYTE-IDENTICAL to what was under
#         `## [Unreleased]` before — the tool writes no prose
#     P4  the fresh block contains NOTHING but its heading and the eight
#         category headings
#
#   T — THE TAG (§9.3 + C7)
#     T1  exactly ONE new tag, and it matches `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`
#                                                                 KILLS m2
#     T2  the tag names the tip of the current branch
#     T3  nothing was pushed: the fixture has NO remote at all, and the cut
#         still succeeds
#
#   W — `shipped_in` THROUGH THE SEAM (§7.1)
#     W1  every unshipped closed row now carries the tag; an already-shipped
#         row is untouched
#     W2  WRITE-ONCE: a second cut refuses with 8 and rewrites nothing
#     W3  STRUCTURAL: the script contains no direct write to the state file —
#         the ship pathway is the only route
#
#   A — ADJACENCIES AND CONSTRAINTS
#     A1  `--finalize-phase` is NOT wired (C8/Q3 — Karl did not decide it)
#     A2  there is NO semver override flag (§9.1, §13-R2)
#     A3  the boundary lint stays rc 0 and the seam allowlist stays at ONE
#     A4  every refusal prints what would clear it (§4.3's plain register)
#     A5  refusal 2's rc-3 backstop, pinned AT THE LINE — plus the subset
#         argument BY EXECUTION that makes rc 3 unreachable through the
#         front door, so the arm is a genuine backstop and not dead code
#                                                                 KILLS m8
#
#   M — MUTATIONS (anchored, sites==1, one line changed, mode preserved,
#       fresh fixtures, both trees executed)
#     m1  suppress the open-retro refusal   -> a release cuts with a retro
#         outstanding: the collateral on D3's loan is never called in
#     m2  emit `v1.2.0-rc1`                 -> the C7 defence
#     m3  collapse cadence rc 2 into a pass -> an unmeasured cadence
#         silently satisfies a release, which is BL-213 one level up
#     m4  reorder the semver precedence     -> a feature ships as a patch
#     m5  suppress the open-delta refusal   -> a release cuts mid-delta
#     m7  neuter the major revalidation     -> a breaking release skips the
#         §8.2 full re-run
#     m6  weaken the catch-everything-else cadence arm -> DELETING the
#         checker cuts a release. THE REVIEWER'S SURVIVING MUTANT
#     m8  narrow the retro backstop to rc 0 only -> an UNDETERMINED ledger
#         stops refusing. The reviewer's second survivor
#     m9  restore the old `BUMP=patch` fallback -> an unreadable class
#         ships as a patch
#
# THREE OF THOSE NINE EXIST BECAUSE THIS SUITE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. m6 and m8
# are mutants an adversarial review built against MARKED arms of this product
# and watched survive the whole suite at 31/0; m9 is the reachable form of a
# fallback the same review flagged on principle. A marker that calls itself a
# mutation address and has no mutant is a promise the file does not keep, so
# every CUTREL-* marker now carries one.
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml
# `unit-shard` list. Its executed lines never name the init script — the one
# row that reads that file does so through a SPLIT token, the same idiom and
# the same reason as tests/test-delta-wp6-cadence.sh::H6 and
# tests/test-intake-wizard-fixes.sh.

# refusal message ("...the tag and .claude/delta-state.json disagree..." >&2) and
# reported a direct write that does not exist. A pattern that cannot tell a
# filename in prose from a filename in a redirection is not an instrument.
#

# becomes empirical: with the only sanctioned route closed, does the state file
# move at all? If cut-release.sh had any second path to that file — a `jq`, a

# ── A5: refusal 2's rc-3 half, pinned AT THE LINE ──────────────────────────
#
# An adversarial review found this half unkilled: weakening `-ne 1` to `-eq 0`
# survives the whole suite, because rc 3 is UNREACHABLE through the script's
# own flow. The review's own mitigation argument is a subset one, and the
# honest response is not to shrug at it but to make BOTH halves checkable.
#
#   (a) THE SUBSET ARGUMENT, BY EXECUTION. WP5's `_delta_cadence_readable`
#       accepts "an object with a hotfix_retros ARRAY"; WP2's
#       `DELTA_STATE_SHAPE` accepts strictly less. So every document that
#       survives --delta-state-read-strict also satisfies the predicate, and
#       rc 3 cannot arrive through the front door. Asserted, not assumed.
#   (b) THE ARM ITSELF, DRIVEN DIRECTLY. The marked line is lifted out of the
#       product and evaluated against each code WP5's predicate can return.
#       This is what kills the `-eq 0` mutant: it changes rc 3 from a refusal
#       into a pass, and nothing else in the suite can see that.
#
# Pinning an unreachable backstop is worth the twenty lines because that is
# exactly what a backstop IS — the thing that has no reachable witness until
# the day the front door changes.
# _arm_probe <product-file> <rc> — lift the marked line and evaluate it with
#   RETRO_RC set to <rc>; echo the resulting RETRO_REFUSE.
#
#   EVERY STATEMENT GOES ON ITS OWN LINE, and that is not tidiness. The first
#   draft joined them with `;` and the lifted line ENDS IN ITS OWN TRAILING
#   COMMENT — so the `printf` that reads the answer was commented out and every
#   probe returned the empty string. The row went RED, which is the only reason
#   it was caught; a harness that had defaulted to "n" on an empty read would
#   have reported a passing pin over a probe that never ran.
