# tests/test-brownfield-wp1-scout.sh — behaviour suite for Scout, the
# read-only brownfield scanner (WP1-brownfield).
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md — §3.1 (Scout is the
# read-only scanner, packaged standalone), §3.3 M1/M5 (one directory, one entry
# script, zero core dependencies), §8.2 (the NORMATIVE report schema and the two
# reuse-by-extraction rows), §4.2 (evidence + confidence tiers), §4.4 (the
# phase-placement ladder and its three corrections), §10-WP1. The standing
# module rules are transcribed in docs/module-contract.md.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS PROTECTING
#
# Scout has exactly two hard properties, and everything else in the design
# serves them:
#
#   READ-ONLY.  Scout writes NOTHING into the tree it scans. This is proven by
#   TREE HASH before/after over the WHOLE fixture — path + type + mode + content
#   for every entry including `.git/` — never by reading the source and
#   believing it. §10-WP1 names the tree-hash proof specifically, because the
#   predicate Scout extracts (process-checklist.sh's verify_init) opens with
#   `ensure_state_file` and appends to `.phase2_init.steps_completed` on every
#   passing probe. The extraction deletes those writes; R1/R2 are what keep
#   them deleted, and X2 is the proof that R1/R2 can actually bite.
#
#   ZERO-DEPENDENCY (M5).  Scout sources no core lib and runs in a clone that
#   has never been near init.sh. H1 proves it the strong way — Scout's files are
#   copied into an otherwise EMPTY tree and run there. H2 proves the WP0
#   carry-forward (review finding R-WP0-3): the lint's M5 arm forbids core
#   *lib* basenames only, so a Scout file that shelled out to a core ENTRY
#   script would pass the lint clean, and a hermetic test that moved only
#   `scripts/lib/` aside would pass too. H2 therefore moves `scripts/*.sh`
#   aside as well. X4 runs the real lint against a mutated copy.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EXIT CODES AND VALUES, NEVER LABELS. Every assertion reads an exit code, a
# jq-extracted JSON value, or a file/tree hash. None reads a printed banner —
# CLAUDE.md's [WARN] trap is precisely that the label and the outcome disagree.
#
# MUTATION PROOFS (X1-X4). Each builds a COPY of Scout, applies ONE anchored
# single-site neuter, asserts the copy really changed by exactly the expected
# number of lines (`_changed_lines`), runs the mutant, and requires the pinned
# assertion to flip. A control run of the UNMUTATED copy is asserted in the
# same case, so "the mutant failed" can never be a fixture accident. The
# in-place editor preserves file mode (`_sed_inplace`): the obvious spelling
# ends `chmod +x`, which silently promotes a 0644 lib to 0755 and rides along
# in the next commit.
#
#   X1  ladder: prefix-max -> last-wins  => the HANDOFF fixture reports 4, not 2
#   X2  a probe writes state             => the tree-hash proof (R1/R2) reds
#   X3  branch_protection consults a file => its `unknown` pin reds
#   X4  a Scout file sources a core lib   => scripts/lint-module-dependencies.sh reds
#
# HERMETICITY: every fixture is a `mktemp -d` tree. No network, no host CLI, no
# real remote — the one fixture remote is a `git remote add` of an unreachable
# URL, which is a config write and nothing more. Scout itself is never given a
# host credential to use. bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no `${var,,}`,
# no `mapfile`, no `((x++))`.
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the
# .github/workflows/tests.yml `unit-shard` list. This suite never mentions,
# copies or executes the scaffolder, so it is a unit-lane test outright and
# must NOT appear in `lint-tests-registered.sh --list | grep unit-lane-exempt`.

# ── X3: make branch_protection consult anything -> its unknown pin reds ───
# The mutant restores the pre-2026-04-21 proxy check ("a CI yaml exists, so
# protection must be on"). It consults the filesystem rather than the host, so
# it is the MILDEST possible violation of "no host calls" — and V4 still has to
# catch it, because the property being defended is `unknown`, not `no network`.
#
# Anchored the same two-part way as X1, and for the same reason: the marker
# must resolve to the EXECUTED assignment, never to a line that merely names
# it. `bp_exec_sites` is the standing guard — if a future edit adds a prose
# citation, this case fails loudly instead of silently mutating a comment.
