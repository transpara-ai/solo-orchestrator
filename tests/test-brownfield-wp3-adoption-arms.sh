#
# Brownfield adoption WP3 — the IN-CORE ENABLING ARMS. Design:
# docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md §10-WP3 (deliverables and
# proofs), §3.1/§3.2 (why the arms are in-core), §5.3 (the per-gate mapping;
# the TDD ordering row is kind (c)), §8.5 (the stamp's home, its
# merge-versus-re-stamp reasoning, and the five existing-file writers), §9
# (what does not change).
#
# WP3 is the design's own named LINCHPIN: it is the only brownfield package
# that touches a gate.
#
# ── THE [WARN] TRAP (repo CLAUDE.md; §10's preamble) ────────────────────────
# In check-phase-gate.sh the `[WARN]` / `[FAIL]` text is COSMETIC — the exit
# predicate is `if [ $issues -eq 0 ]`. An exemption is the ABSENCE of an
# `issues=$((issues + 1))`; a block is its presence. Of the 66 increment sites,
# 34 print `[WARN]` and 10 print `[FAIL]`. So EVERY verdict in this file is
# asserted on an EXIT CODE. Printed strings appear only as PATH DISCRIMINATORS
# (see below) and never as a verdict.
#
# ── Structural discriminators (this wave's harness standard) ────────────────
# Three of the proofs below expect an ABSENCE as the mutant's result (no block,
# no finding, no report). Several DIFFERENT edits share that one downstream
# silence — a mutant that dies on a syntax error is also silent. Every such
# proof therefore carries a discriminator that only the INTENDED path can
# satisfy: the mutant must still load its library and still answer the accessor
# correctly, and (where the path is observable) must print the arm's own
# message. The exit code remains the verdict; the discriminator only proves
# WHICH path produced it.
#
# ── Scenarios ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   A1..A4  The `adopted` flag accessor. Absent file, absent block and
#           `adopted:false` all read NOT ADOPTED — a greenfield project must be
#           untouched by every arm in this WP (§10-WP3 deliverable 1).
#   S1      soif_adoption_stamp is an ADDITIVE merge: a foreign top-level
#           manifest key survives it, and the written block carries §8.5's
#           schema.
#   S2      No-op on a missing manifest (the `[ -f … ] || return 0` idiom
#           soif_currency_stamp uses).
#   S3      The five existing-file manifest writers named in §8.5 are run IN
#           SEQUENCE over a stamped manifest and the stamp is still present
#           afterwards. Each writer's jq filter is PINNED at sites==1 in its
#           own shipped source, so a writer that changes shape fails this test
#           loudly instead of leaving it exercising a stale copy.
#   S4      A scenario outside §8.5's `completed|in-flight` enum is REFUSED —
#           a durable record must not be written malformed.
#   T1/T2   TDD arm, DIRECTION (i): an adopted project's pre-adoption commit is
#           exempt (T1, rc 0); neuter the exemption guard and the SAME fixture
#           blocks (T2, rc 1).
#   T3/T4   TDD arm, DIRECTION (ii) — THE ONE THAT MATTERS. A post-adoption
#           commit with no test BLOCKS (T3, rc 1); neuter the BOUND and it
#           PASSES (T4, rc 0). An unbounded exemption is a permanent TDD waiver
#           wearing an adoption badge, so T4 is the proof this WP turns on.
#   T5      Greenfield regression: no adoption block ⇒ the gate behaves exactly
#           as it did before this WP (rc 1 on a non-bypassable tier).
#   T6      Tier behaviour is UNTOUCHED (§9): a bypassable tier still warns and
#           allows post-adoption.
#   G1..G4  Stamp acceptance in the gate, and the loss detector: intact ⇒ no
#           finding (G1); committed-at-HEAD but gone from the working tree ⇒
#           the gate exits NON-ZERO (G2); neuter the detector ⇒ the project
#           SILENTLY un-adopts and the gate exits 0 (G3); a mid-adoption
#           project whose stamp is not yet committed raises no false alarm
#           (G4).
#
# The REAL regenerate path (delete the manifest → verify-install.sh --auto-fix
# → fix_framework_manifest → the upstream CDF writer rewrites it wholesale) is
# proved in tests/test-brownfield-wp3-regenerate-path.sh, which is deliberately
# a separate suite: it executes the upstream installer and is therefore
# unit-lane exempt, while everything here stays in the fast lane.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only, no network, no remote creation.

# WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS. T1-T6 shipped 19/19 green while the bound was
# DEFEATABLE BY EVERYDAY GIT. The refuted model was this file's own first
# comment: "P not an ancestor => a branch cut before adoption => EXEMPT". That
# state is UNREACHABLE for a genuinely pre-adoption branch — such a branch has
# the PRE-adoption manifest checked out, so the accessor reads NOT ADOPTED and
# the arm never runs. Every state that actually reaches the "not an ancestor"
# arm carries the STAMPED tree, which means adoption already happened. The old
# arm therefore exempted only post-adoption commits — the exact inversion of
# §4.5.
#
# The T-series never constructed a divergent history, which is precisely why
# the hole and a green suite coexisted. So this battery is not one regression
# for one attack: it pins ALL TEN histories the reviewer drove, six of which
# produced an exempt post-adoption commit (rc 0 + the exemption banner) against
# the shipped code. Four of the six need no intent at all — a local `git
# rebase`, a SQUASH MERGE (a GitHub default, and the worst: it exempts every
# subsequent mainline commit forever), an orphan branch, and a cherry-pick.
#
# T1 remains the indispensable control: a predicate that simply blocked
# everything would pass all ten of these and be just as wrong.
# Verdicts are EXIT CODES. Non-zero = the gate refused the commit = correct.
