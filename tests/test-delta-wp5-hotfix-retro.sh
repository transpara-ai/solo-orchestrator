# tests/test-delta-wp5-hotfix-retro.sh — Delta Track WP5.
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-delta-track-v1.md §5.2 (the per-class gate
# table, its hotfix row, and "reading the hotfix row honestly" — the fast lane
# is a LOAN, collateralised by the release refusal), §5.2's incident-response
# seam paragraph (the two clocks differ on purpose and neither is built into the
# other), §7.1 (`hotfix_retros[]` — an array that OUTLIVES `active_delta`
# deliberately), §7.2 (`retro_due_days`, and the gate-token equivalence note:
# hotfix carries no `close_review` because `retro_review` IS its close review,
# arriving late), §9.2 (the release refusals WP7 will build on the predicates
# this WP ships), §11-WP5.
#
# (No `# BL-NNN-…` marker anywhere in the delta track on purpose: no backlog
# entry exists for this build and minting one would red
# scripts/lint-bl-markers.sh, whose first pass resolves every marker to a real
# `## BL-NNN:` entry. The design-doc path above is the citation, per the WP1,
# WP2, WP3 and WP4 precedent.)
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE ONE PROPERTY THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR
#
# A hotfix ships fast by BORROWING rigor. The retro is the repayment. So the
# retro ledger must OUTLIVE the delta's close — if closing the delta also closed
# the retro, the loan is forgiven the instant it is taken out and the entire
# §5.2 design intent is gone, silently, with every visible surface still saying
# the right things. S1 is that property and m2 is the mutant that proves S1 can
# see it.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXIT CODES, NEVER LABELS
#
# Every assertion below reads a process EXIT CODE, a JSON value read back off
# disk, or a byte-level md5 / whole-tree manifest. None reads a printed
# [OK]/[WARN]/[FAIL] banner. CLAUDE.md's `[WARN]` trap is exactly that the label
# and the exit predicate can disagree — and WP6's sibling defect (BL-213's
# fail-open class) is the same disease in date form: check-maintenance.sh today
# prints "All maintenance cadences current" at rc 0 for a date it could not
# read. O2 and m3 pin the WP5 half of that repair ON THE EXIT CODE.
#
# The codes this WP adds to scripts/delta.sh:
#     11  there is no retro on the record with that id
#     12  that retro is already filed — the record is write-once
# and the ones it inherits and re-reads: 0 ok, 2 invocation error, 6 nothing
# open, 7 gates outstanding.
#
# The codes scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh answers with — the interface WP7's
# cut-release.sh consumes, asserted here so WP7 can build against it:
#     delta_retro_overdue     0 OVERDUE (including an unreadable due_by), 1 open
#                             and not yet due, 2 no OPEN retro with that id
#     delta_any_open_retro    0 at least one open retro, 1 none
#     delta_any_overdue_retro 0 at least one open retro that is overdue or
#                             unreadable, 1 none
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, AND WHICH MUTANT EACH ROW KILLS
#
#   H — THE HOTFIX FAST LANE AT OPEN (§5.2)
#     H1  a hotfix materialises EXACTLY the §5.2 row and NOTHING heavier — the
#         set is asserted whole, not as a subset; no brief is demanded anywhere;
#         and the open CREATES no file outside the two `.claude/` documents, so
#         the floor (§5.1) is inherited rather than re-implemented.
#         AMENDED BY WP8 / Karl's decision of 2026-08-09: the open now also
#         APPENDS one row to the existing BUGS.md. That is the hotfix audit
#         trace made visible — the reviewer's evidence was that the state
#         document's `audit_row_at_open` stamp survives neither an abandoned
#         hotfix nor a lost state file, so the audit trail it promises does not
#         persist. H1 therefore no longer demands that BUGS.md be byte-identical;
#         it demands that BUGS.md be the ONLY thing that moved, and that it moved
#         by exactly one added line naming the delta. That is a stronger
#         assertion than the one it replaced, not a relaxation of it.
#     H2  the AUDIT ROW IS WRITTEN AT OPEN, not at close: the stamp is on the
#         record and the gate is already complete the moment the delta opens —
#         it is the one gate in the system nobody attests, because the framework
#         did it
#     H3  and the trace survives ABANDONMENT — a hotfix that never closes still
#         left it, and its id is never handed out again
#
#   L — THE RETRO LEDGER, APPENDED AT OPEN (§7.1)
#     L1  the row is appended AT OPEN with exactly §7.1's five keys and
#         due_by = shipped_at + 3 days (Karl set 3, not 7)             KILLS m1
#     L2  `retro_due_days` is READ FROM POLICY: retune it and the date moves
#                                                                      KILLS m5
#     L3  no other class writes a retro row
#
#   S — THE RETRO OUTLIVES THE CLOSE (the whole point)
#     S1  closing the hotfix delta nulls `active_delta` and grows `closed` — and
#         leaves the retro row byte-identically OPEN                   KILLS m2
#     S2  the close is not BLOCKED by the open retro, but it IS blocked when the
#         retro row is absent: fail-closed, rc 7, naming retro_review  KILLS m6
#     S3  `--complete-gate retro_review` is refused — the loan cannot be repaid
#         by ticking a box, which is §7.2's "the loan going unrepaid" spelled as
#         the one thing that would make it happen
#
#   T — `--retro`
#     T1  closes EXACTLY one retro; the other open row is untouched; the write
#         is one atomic seam call and its residue is bounded to that row's two
#         fields
#     T2  a second `--retro` on the same id is refused (12)            KILLS m4
#     T3  an unknown id (11) and a missing record (2) are refused
#     T4  THE RECORD CONTRACT, honestly kinded: a value that names an existing
#         file is recorded as `file`, anything else as `attested` — the
#         framework never claims to have read a write-up it cannot find
#
#   O — OVERDUE ARITHMETIC (scripts/lib/delta-cadence.sh)
#     O1  2 days old is not overdue at the default 3; 4 days old is; a project
#         that retunes to 7 finds the same 4-day-old retro current
#     O2  AN UNREADABLE `due_by` IS OVERDUE, NOT SILENTLY CURRENT — BL-213's
#         fail-open class, refused here                                KILLS m3
#     O3  the whole-ledger predicates in all four states
#     O4  the parse helper: GNU-first `date -d`, BSD `date -j -f` fallback,
#         rc 1 AND NO OUTPUT on garbage, and a bare date normalised to midnight
#         UTC so BSD's fill-from-now can never leak in
#
#   V — `--status` RENDERS OPEN AND OVERDUE RETROS
#     V1  with nothing open and with a delta open; overdue named as overdue; an
#         unreadable date named as unreadable AND late; and — the structural
#         discriminator — a filed retro appears nowhere
#
#   N — REFUSAL RESIDUE (the WP4 standard, inherited verbatim)
#     N1  every `--retro` refusal leaves the WHOLE TREE byte-for-byte as it
#         found it, asserted as a find-based manifest with a per-file md5
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# COUNTERFACTUAL DISCIPLINE — how the mutations below are built
#
# Inherited from tests/test-delta-wp3-era-classify.sh and
# tests/test-delta-wp4-close-rubric.sh, unchanged, because it is what makes a
# mutation proof a proof:
#
#   • ANCHORED SINGLE-SITE addresses. Every marker is pinned to END-OF-LINE
#     (`/# DELTA-OPEN-RETRO-APPEND$/`), never a bare substring — WP2's suite
#     records what over-matching costs.
#   • THREE PROPERTIES ASSERTED BEFORE THE RESULT IS BELIEVED: the marker
#     resolves to EXACTLY ONE line in the pristine file; the mutant DIFFERS from
#     it; and EXACTLY ONE LINE changed (one `<` and one `>`).
#   • MODE-PRESERVING harness. `_sed_inplace` reads each file's mode and puts it
#     back; the obvious `chmod +x` spelling silently turns a sourced 0644 lib
#     into 0755 and the mode rides along in the next commit.
#   • FRESH-FIXTURE ISOLATION. Every mutation builds its own mktemp project, and
#     the fixture must REACH the guard under test — m6's fixture has to have the
#     retro row removed, or the bind is satisfied for the honest reason and the
#     mutant looks pinned when it is not.
#   • STRUCTURAL DISCRIMINATORS WHERE THE EXPECTED RESULT IS AN ABSENCE. Five of
#     the six mutants below expect "the refusal did not happen", which is the
#     same answer a fixture that never reached the guard would give. Each of
#     those rows therefore also asserts a POSITIVE consequence of the mutation
#     having landed — the mutant's ledger is EMPTY while the pristine tree's
#     carries a row (m1); the mutant's retro is CLOSED with the delta's own
#     closed_at while the pristine tree's is still open (m2); the mutant's
#     record still holds the FIRST write-up while reporting the second as saved
#     (m4); the mutant's due_by interval is 3 days under a policy that says 9
#     (m5); the mutant closed a hotfix whose ledger has no row at all (m6) — and
#     every one of them is measured against the PRISTINE tree run on an
#     identical fixture in the same case.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# HERMETICITY: every fixture is a mktemp -d project carrying NO init.sh and NO
# templates/generated, so guard_not_in_framework sees a project and not the
# framework. Git fixtures configure an identity and unset GITHUB_BASE_REF. No
# remote is ever created; nothing reaches the network; nothing is written inside
# the checkout. bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no ${var,,}, no ((x++)).
#
# TIME: no test overrides "now". Ageing a retro is done by shifting BOTH
# `shipped_at` and `due_by` back by the same amount through the seam, so the
# INTERVAL between them — the product's own arithmetic — is preserved exactly
# and only the row's age moves. A suite that faked `now` would be pinning its
# own clock.
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the tests.yml
# `unit-shard` list. Its executed lines never name init.sh.

# Since R-WP5-1 the seam refuses the crude spelling (`closed_at` set with
# `record` left null dies on RETRO-ATOM-FILE-RECORD-OBJECT), so an earlier cut
# of this mutant was killed by the guard instead of by S1 and proved nothing
# about S1 at all — a mutant dying for the wrong reason. It now writes exactly
# what `--retro` writes: a stamp and a record object, one row, seam-legal. That
# is the residual the guard deliberately cannot close (a filing is a filing;
# the state layer protects identity, not truthfulness), and it is exactly why
