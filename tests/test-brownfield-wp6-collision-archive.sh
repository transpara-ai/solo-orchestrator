# tests/test-brownfield-wp6-collision-archive.sh — behaviour suite for the
# collision archive, its MANIFEST, the disclosure, the re-add warning and its
# audit row, and §7.3's archive-secrets refusal (WP6-brownfield).
#
# SPEC: docs/designs/2026-08-02-brownfield-adoption-v1.md — §7.1 (the four
# buckets), §7.2 (archive layout and MANIFEST, and the five properties
# inherited from `_upgrade_snapshot_pre_mutation`), §7.3 (disclosure, the
# re-add warning, and THE NEW EXPOSURE: archiving a `.git/hooks/` file promotes
# an UNTRACKED file into version control), §8.9 (the `adoption_event` row and
# the five surfaces a new row type touches), §10-WP6, §12-5.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS PROTECTING, IN ONE SENTENCE
#
# The archive collects files the operator wrote — hooks, AI settings, MCP
# connections — and stages them into a commit, so a credential that was
# UNTRACKED or GITIGNORED before adoption can be committed BY adoption. §7.3
# says the driver must scan the archive before staging and refuse a matching
# entry, and this suite proves the refusal with a real planted key.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE PLANT, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS (§6.5's fixture preconditions,
# applied to a different surface)
#
#   HOOK_PLANT  AKIA3XN7QW5ZTBMR2VKD  — in the fixture's .git/hooks/pre-commit.
#
# It matches `AKIA[A-Z2-7]{16}`. BASE32-VALIDITY IS LOAD-BEARING: the
# `aws-access-token` rule requires the 16 characters after `AKIA` to be drawn
# from [A-Z2-7], so a plant containing a `9` or a `1` yields ZERO findings and
# every assertion below passes for the wrong reason. `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` is
# separately allowlisted by gitleaks' own default config and also yields zero.
# S0 therefore asserts a NON-ZERO finding count AND that the probe can see the
# plant in the archive copy BEFORE any absence is asserted — a dud fixture
# fails loudly instead of certifying nothing.
#
# `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is the right carrier and not an arbitrary one: git
# never tracks `.git/`, so the plant is provably absent from the adoptee's
# history before adoption runs. Any occurrence in the commit is one THIS
# DESIGN created.
#
# EVERY ABSENCE ASSERTION HAS A POSITIVE CONTROL. The archive's copy of the
# hook is the operator's own file and MUST contain the plant — that is what an
# archive is. So the probe is proven able to see the plant (S0, exactly one
# occurrence in the archive copy) before it is used to assert zero occurrences
# in the MANIFEST, the transcript, the ledger and the committed tree. The
# committed-tree probe gets its own control too: `git grep` over HEAD must find
# a token that IS committed, or "found nothing" would mean "looked at nothing".
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE MUTATIONS
#
#   S4  neuter the pre-staging scan (ONE marked line)  -> the secret-bearing
#                                                         archive entry is
#                                                         COMMITTED and the
#                                                         plant is in the
#                                                         committed tree -> RED
#   R2  neuter the re-add audit row (ONE marked line)  -> the file is still
#                                                         restored and NO row
#                                                         is written: a SILENT
#                                                         re-add -> RED
#   E6  neuter the emitter's type literal              -> the REAL T6 predicate,
#                                                         extracted from
#                                                         tests/test-bl029-integration.sh,
#                                                         rejects the ledger -> RED
#
# R2 asserts the file bytes as well as the row count, because a mutant that
# died before doing anything leaves the same "no row" state a correct refusal
# does. E6 exists because §8.9's own indictment of the two previous row types
# is that their pins run over fixture ledgers that never contain them — a
# whitelist entry with no fixture exercising it is a pin that cannot go red.
#
# EXIT CODES AND VALUES, NEVER LABELS (CLAUDE.md's [WARN] trap).
#
# GITLEAKS IS DETECTED, NEVER ASSUMED, and a skip is LOUD — and FATAL in CI.
# The posture is WP2's, for WP2's reason: a green required check credited with
# a leak proof that never ran is the silent-success class sitting on the
# highest-stakes property in this design. The workflows install a pinned,
# checksum-verified gitleaks in every unit shard, so this arm fires only if
# that install is removed or breaks.
#
# HERMETICITY: every fixture is a `mktemp -d` tree; no network, no real remote.
# bash-3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no `${var,,}`, no `mapfile`, no
# `((x++))`.
#
# LANE: registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh AND in the
# .github/workflows/tests.yml `unit-shard` list. `mk_mirror` NAMES init.sh on
# an executed line (the driver derives the shipped-script set from init.sh's
# own copy list, so a mutation mirror must carry it), which makes this suite
# unit-lane-EXEMPT by `# BL-181-UNIT-LANE-PREDICATE`. It is registered in the
# unit list anyway — the suite never runs the scaffolder, and the lint says an
# exempted file that is in the list anyway "decided nothing and is not
# rendered". Spelling the name plainly and registering it is the honest
# combination; dodging the predicate with a glob would hide the decision.

# ── HOST GIT CONFIG IS NEUTRALIZED, AND IT HAD TO BE (R-WP6-3) ─────────────
#
# MEASURED ON THIS HOST, NOT ANTICIPATED. `~/.config/git/ignore` contains
# `**/.claude/settings.local.json`. That is the ecosystem-standard line, it is
# on a great many developer machines, and it is a GLOBAL EXCLUDES FILE — so
# `git check-ignore` inside a fixture consulted it and reported the fixture's
# ARCHIVE COPY as ignored. On this laptop the R-WP6-1 exposure was therefore
# invisible; on a CI runner, which has no such file, it was live. A fixture
# whose verdict is decided by whose machine it runs on is not a fixture.
#
# `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` DOES NOT COVER THIS and that is the trap worth spelling
# out: the excludes file is found at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` (falling
# back to `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`), which is a PATH DEFAULT, not a config
# key. Pointing GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL at /dev/null neutralizes `core.excludesFile`
# and nothing else. XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the knob that matters, and H0 below
# proves it in both directions rather than asserting it.
#
# Same class as the house rules' `GITHUB_BASE_REF` provision: the fixture must
# own every input git reads.

# THE FILE SCOPES ARE NOT ALL THE SCOPES (R-WP6-13). Three more channels reach
# git without touching any file the four exports above neutralise, and the
# first of them OUTRANKS every one of them:
#
#   GIT_CONFIG_COUNT / GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n / GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n
#       COMMAND scope, which is the highest precedence git has. Measured: with
#       every file scope pointed at /dev/null, one of these pairs setting
#       `core.excludesFile` still decides a fixture path. Unsetting COUNT is
#       sufficient and is the whole gate — git reads it first and ignores the
#       KEY_n/VALUE_n pairs entirely without it.
#   GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR
#       Seeds `info/exclude` into EVERY repository `git init` creates, so it
#       reaches fixtures that are created after this line runs. Measured: a
#       template `info/exclude` decides a fresh fixture's paths.
#   GIT_DIR / GIT_WORK_TREE / GIT_INDEX_FILE / GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY / …
#       Live whenever anything runs a suite from inside a git hook, which
#       points fixture operations at the WRONG REPOSITORY.
#
# None is set on this host, so this is a completeness fix against the principle
# the block above states — the fixture must own every input git reads — rather
# than a live hazard. H0b measures the first two in both directions anyway,
# because "not set today" is a property of today.
#   GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS (R-WP6-15)
#       The fourth channel, and it arrives in EXACTLY the scenario the GIT_DIR
#       line above names: `git -c foo.bar=baz` exports it to every child, so a
#       suite run from inside a hook inherits it. Measured: with every file
#       scope neutralised and GIT_CONFIG_COUNT unset,
#       GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS="'core.excludesFile'='…'" still decides a fixture
#       path. H0b's third direction pins it.

# _add_surfaces DIR [PLANT] — the archive-and-replace surfaces the adoptee
# already occupies (§7.1's first row), and DELIBERATELY NOT ALL OF THEM.
#
# `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` are LEFT ABSENT on purpose:
# §7.2's "only files that exist are archived" is a claim that needs a negative
# to be worth asserting, and a fixture that carries every surface can only
# prove the positive half.
#
# The pre-commit hook names two tools from the description generator's closed
# vocabulary (`npx`, `lint-staged`) so the §7.2 description requirement has a
# POSITIVE control, and — when a plant is passed — carries a BASE32-valid key
# in an `export` line, which is the §7.3 hazard in its most ordinary form.
#
# THE HOOK MUST EXIT 0, AND FINDING OUT WHY COST A FAILING MUTATION. WP4
# installs the framework's hooks AFTER the adoption commit on purpose: the
# adoptee's OWN hooks judge that commit. A fixture hook that really ran
# `npx lint-staged` therefore exited 127 on a host without npx, the adoption
# commit was REJECTED, and two probes went quiet about it — S1's `git ls-files`
# reads the INDEX, which is populated whether or not the commit lands, and S2's
# "the plant is in no committed file" was trivially true because there was no
# adoption commit at all. S4's mutation is what surfaced it: the mutant staged
# the secret-bearing entry exactly as predicted and the plant still could not
# be found in HEAD. The hook now names its tools in a comment and exits 0 —
# §7.2's description is a SHALLOW STATIC READ of the whole file, so the
# positive control is unaffected — every tracked-ness probe reads
# `git ls-tree HEAD`, and every case that depends on a commit asserts the

#
# G6 pinned "a corrupt ledger must not be committed in silence" using ONE
# corruption spelling — a file of garbage — which `jq` refuses with rc 5. The
# fix rested on the inference that a zero rc from `bypass_audit_append` proves
# the ledger parsed, "since the appender's own jq had to read it". THAT IS
# FALSE, and it is false for the most ordinary corruption there is. Measured:
#
#   ledger      append rc   docs out   rows written   proposed guard rc
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   empty         0            0          none              1     <- SILENT LOSS
#   null          0            1          1                 1     <- silent repair
#   multidoc      0            2          2                 1     <- silent DUPLICATE

#
# `jq FILTER file` over a ZERO-BYTE file runs the filter across zero input
# documents, emits nothing and exits 0. The append "succeeds", `mv`s an empty
# temp over the empty file, and appends nothing. A zero-byte file is THE
# canonical truncation artifact — bypass-audit.sh's own D3 comment worries
# about a SIGKILL truncating this very file — so this is not an exotic input.
#
# THE FIX BELONGS TO THE APPENDER, NOT TO THIS PACKAGE'S CALLER. Six files call
# `bypass_audit_append`, and the two loud-fail arms in hook-templates.sh
# (`# BL-163`, `# BL-185`) already test its rc and announce a `[note]` when it
# fails — so today they announce nothing on a truncated ledger and lose the row.
# Guarding here would have fixed one caller and left five.
#
# G6c pins the LIBRARY CONTRACT over every spelling, with the valid case as the
# positive control so the guard cannot be "always refuse". G6b pins the
# end-to-end consequence for the zero-byte spelling specifically, which is the
