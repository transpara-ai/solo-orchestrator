#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/test-bl099-guard-coverage.sh — SYSTEMATIC guard-coverage harness for the
# BL-099 --sync-framework code paths (scripts/upgrade-project.sh).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (round 4). Four consecutive adversarial reviews each found a
# DIFFERENT surviving mutation in this safety-critical code (it rewrites files inside
# live user projects). Each round pinned the one guard the reviewer named; the next
# reviewer found the next unpinned guard. That is whack-a-mole. This harness makes
# guard coverage SYSTEMATIC and SELF-ENFORCING: it holds an explicit REGISTRY of
# every load-bearing guard, and for each one it NEUTERS a throwaway copy of the real
# script and proves the BL-099 regression suite goes RED — then restores and proves
# it goes GREEN. A guard with no killing test cannot be added to the registry, and a
# guard that is silently un-pinned makes THIS harness fail. Round 5 cannot find a
# survivor that this registry does not already enumerate.
#
# HOW EACH ROW IS CHECKED (the anti-cheat rules, all enforced per row):
#   1. copy the REAL scripts/upgrade-project.sh into a mutant framework tree;
#   2. apply the neuter (a literal sed/awk transform — flip a dry-run test, gut a
#      function body, delete/replace one line);
#   3. assert the mutant DIFFERS from pristine (a neuter that changed nothing is a
#      mis-targeted string — hard fail, never a vacuous pass);
#   4. assert the named marker comment is STILL present (a neuter that removed the
#      marker would let a marker-grep test pass vacuously — we attack BEHAVIOUR);
#   5. assert `bash -n` still passes (a syntax-broken mutant proves nothing);
#   6. run the BL-099 suite (JUST the named killing test, via BL099_ONLY) against the
#      mutant tree (via BL099_REPO_OVERRIDE) and assert it EXITS NON-ZERO — RED;
#   7. restore pristine and assert the same test EXITS ZERO — GREEN. This proves the
#      RED was caused by the neuter, not by the environment.
#
# The suite it drives (tests/test-upgrade-sync-framework.sh) exposes two hooks used
# ONLY here: BL099_REPO_OVERRIDE re-points its framework tree at the mutant, and
# BL099_ONLY runs a single named test. A bare `bash tests/…` run ignores both.
#
# BL-112 EXTENSION. The registry now also covers the two COMMIT-TIME enforcement
# generators — scripts/lib/hook-templates.sh (the emitted pre-commit hook) and
# scripts/install-filesystem-gates.sh (the emitted strict framework gate) — whose
# guards are killed by tests/test-bl112-commit-enforcement.sh (BL112_REPO_OVERRIDE
# / BL112_ONLY, the same two hooks by another name). Those rows scaffold a REAL
# project from the mutant tree and attempt a REAL `git commit`, so they are the
# slowest rows here; they are also the only ones that can prove a commit gate
# actually refuses a commit, which is precisely the proof BL-112 was missing.
# Each row therefore declares its TARGET (which file in the mutant tree it
# mutates) and the harness dispatches to the right killing suite.
#
# FAST-LANE: NOT in the tests.yml `unit` list ON PURPOSE. It neuters the script and
# runs the suite ~2x per registry row (~25 rows), so it is minutes, not seconds —
# an aggregator-only test (registered in tests/full-project-test-suite.sh). It does
# NOT invoke init.sh. lint-tests-registered.sh is satisfied by the aggregator entry.
#
# CITATION: guards are neutered by a grep-able marker / function name / literal
# construct, never a bare file:line (the repo's CITATION RULE). bash-3.2 safe;
# hermetic (CDF_HOME pinned nowhere by the driven suite); no real remotes.

# ── THE PER-SECTION TARGET (BL-113, 2026-07-12) ────────────────────────────────
# The registry originally pinned exactly one script (upgrade-project.sh) with one
# killing suite. The BL-113 anti-laundering guards live in DIFFERENT scripts and
# are killed by a DIFFERENT suite, so three knobs are now section-scoped:
#   PRISTINE      the real script a row mutates (the neuter primitives all edit $MUT)
#   MUT           its copy inside $MUTANT_TREE
#   GUARD_RUNNER  the function that runs the named killing test against $MUTANT_TREE
# Every existing row keeps the BL-099 defaults below — nothing about them changes.
#
# MERGE NOTE (BL-112 × BL-113): both branches independently needed exactly this and
# each grew its own version — BL-113's `use_target <pristine> <mut> <runner>` and
# BL-112's `_select_target <kind>` enum. ONE survives: `use_target`, which is
# strictly the more general of the two (arbitrary script, arbitrary killing suite,
# no central enum to edit). The BL-112 rows are expressed in terms of it below.

# ── (K3) S3 REVIEW ROUND 2 — THE I11 PAYLOAD GUARD + the two unpinned fence halves ─
# THE PATTERN THIS ROUND ENDS. The I11 consent fence was caught HOLLOW three times on
# one change, each time in a different arm — gate items rendered diffstat-only (r1); hook
# items emitted an EMPTY ```diff block under a heading promising a full diff, because hook
# rows carry path "-" (r1 fix round); a RENAMED gate script emitted an empty block because
# `rename` had no arm in _soif_plan_unified_diff (r2). Three instances, ONE root cause:
# nothing asserted that an I11 item's promised diff actually HAD a payload. The r1 hook
# "fix" even shipped with a passing test, because the test grepped the HEADING.
#
# So the invariant is now STRUCTURAL, not per-verb: _soif_plan_diff_has_payload runs at
# the single emission site on EVERY I11 item, and an empty/hunkless diff is a hard abort
# that discards the run folder. The rows below pin the guard, both halves of the I11
# predicate, and the tier derivation.

# THE PAYLOAD GUARD ITSELF. Gut _soif_plan_diff_has_payload → it always says "yes, there
# is a payload" → the hollow plan gets OFFERED instead of aborting. The killing test
# drives it two ways (an empty upstream gate script end-to-end; a synthetic FUTURE verb
# with no diff arm), both of which must hard-error, so this row also proves the guard is
# what makes "every verb needs a diff arm" a machine fact rather than a review habit.

# THE VERB ARMS, via the (class × verb) CROSS-PRODUCT. Delete the `rename)` arm — the
# exact round-2 bug — and the rename falls through to `*)`, which diffs two paths of which
# one never exists on a rename, yielding nothing. The payload guard converts that silent
# hollow block into a named abort, so t_i11_payload_cross_product goes RED. The same holds
# for add/retire/update/hook: the cross-product covers every arm, so a future verb added
# without a diff arm trips this row automatically.

# THE HOOK HALF OF THE I11 PREDICATE. plan/i11-consent-scope (above) neuters only the GATE
# half (_soif_plan_is_enforcement_path). A two-clause fence needs a kill per clause, so
# this row neuters the HOOK clause: `[ "$class" = "hook" ]` never matches → hooks fall out

# THE I11 NORMALIZATION IN soif_plan_run — now genuinely load-bearing. It USED to be a
# second opinion (every derivation arm decided I11 consent for itself and this line
# re-decided it), so neutering it changed nothing and the suite stayed 19/19 green while
# the PR body called it "the single load-bearing point". The derivation arms now emit the
# ordinary `batch` default and THIS is the only place that upgrades the I11 scope to
# `item` — so flipping it to `if false` drops gate scripts AND hooks into the batch
# bucket, and the killing test goes RED. The claim in the code is now true.

# TIER DERIVED FROM THE PATH. The retire arm hard-coded `tier=enforcement` for every
# orphan, so retiring an ordinary script rendered as a ⚠ ENFORCEMENT item — a lie that
# devalues the ⚠ on the items that ARE enforcement machinery. Pin the derivation by

# ── (K4) S3 REVIEW ROUND 3 — PIN THE GUARD'S STRICTNESS, NOT JUST ITS EXISTENCE ────
# The round-2 verifier confirmed the payload guard WORKS (its own class × verb × tier
# cross-product found zero hollow payloads) — and then weakened _soif_plan_diff_has_payload
# to "any non-empty output" and watched all 22 plan tests and all 39 registry rows stay
# GREEN. The guard was real; NOTHING PINNED HOW STRICT IT WAS. `plan/i11-payload` (above)
# only kills the total gutting (`return 0`); every intermediate softening survived. That is
# the WEAK-TEST class reappearing on the very guard built to kill the weak-test class.
#
# So the PREDICATE is now pinned directly, by t_payload_predicate_strictness, which drives
# _soif_plan_diff_has_payload with crafted inputs in BOTH directions. The registry delivers
# the strictness row as a FAMILY — one row per SPECIFIC weakening, because the harness
# applies exactly one neuter per row and "kills the specific weakenings, not merely the
# deletion of the function" is the whole point. Each body keeps the marker, stays
# syntactically valid, and is a plausible careless edit rather than a straw man:
#
#   any-nonempty          the verifier's own weakening: any output at all counts.
#   no-hunk-required      drop the hunk-header clause → loose +/- lines pass as a "diff".
#   no-content-required   drop the content clause → a hunk header alone passes.
#   file-headers-count    the classic: `^[-+]` file-wide, so the ---/+++ FILE HEADERS are
#                         mistaken for content and a header-only block passes.
#   over-strict           the OPPOSITE failure, and a real one — this IS the pre-round-3
#                         predicate. It keyed on a line's SPELLING (`^\+` not followed by
#                         another `+`), so a real diff whose payload TEXT begins with
#                         `+++`/`---` was REJECTED and the plan fail-closed on a legitimate
#                         update. An over-strict guard is a denial-of-service on the
#                         operator's own updates, so the ACCEPT direction is pinned exactly
#                         as hard as the REJECT direction.
