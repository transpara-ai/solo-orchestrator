# ── WALK-ISSUE-010: a CLOSED loop authorizes ITS OWN feature's commit ────────
# Walk of 2026-08-02, ISSUE-010 (Major): the walker read
# CLAUDE.md's Build Loop as "mark the six steps in order, then commit the
# feature". Completing step 6 (feature_recorded) auto-resets .build_loop (the
# UAT-C2 fix U18 pins), so the feature's own `feat:` commit was then blocked
# FOREVER — the gate demanded a loop that the documented order had just
# closed, and its remediation text ("--start-feature ...") dead-ends a junior
# into re-registering a loop for work that is already done.
#
# The fix records a CLOSED-LOOP RECEIPT (.build_loop.last_completed) and
# accepts it for commits that NAME that feature. The bound is IDENTITY, not
# time: U18/U20 prove an unrelated feat: commit is still blocked, so the C2
# grace window stays shut.

# text; the second, non-authored half of the binding is the WORK — the paths
# the loop was actually working on when it closed. A `feat:` commit that names
# the closed feature but stages none of its files is a different piece of work
# and is blocked. Two documented fallbacks, both proven below: a receipt with
# NO recorded paths (a loop closed with a clean tree — the commit-first
# ordering) and a commit with NO staged paths fall back to identity alone,
# because there is nothing to bind against.
#
# mk_git_fixture <feature> <loop-file> — a real repo whose loop closed with
# <loop-file> TRACKED-AND-MODIFIED and <loop-file>.test.ts UNTRACKED, so the
