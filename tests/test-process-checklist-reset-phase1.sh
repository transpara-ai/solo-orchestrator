# reset_process must accept every key that get_steps_for_process accepts
# (including phase1_architecture). reset_all's template must seed every
# such key. ensure_state_file's initial template must do the same. An
# invariant self-test (--invariant-check) confirms this consistency to
# prevent recurrence: adding a new phase to PHASE*_STEPS without wiring
# reset/template support will trip the check.
#
# Note on reset_process tests (T1/T2): reset_process / reset_all gate on
# `[ -t 0 ]` AND prompt_yes_no, both of which refuse in non-interactive
# contexts. We assert the case arm exists via grep on the script and via
# the invariant-check tool. End-to-end reset behaviour is covered by the
# invariant-check (T4) — if the case were missing it would flag a gap.
