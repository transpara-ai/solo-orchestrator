#
# BL-234 — currency and availability must be MEASURED, not DECLARED. Four
# shipped checks asked whether something was configured and reported the answer
# as whether it worked:
#
#   1. scripts/lib/freshness-detect.sh compared a project's pin against the
#      LOCAL clone it was scaffolded from — the same object, by construction —
#      and never fetched. `pin-behind` was structurally incapable of firing, and
#      on `powerpoint-voice` it stayed silent through 161 upstream commits.
#   2. scripts/lib/helpers-full.sh::is_qdrant_mcp_registered tested for an
#      `mcpServers.qdrant` KEY, so a stale global entry made every later project
#      skip provisioning the database.
#   3. scripts/track-tool-usage.sh decided emptiness partly by PHRASE, and
#      matched a stored memory that CONTAINED the words "empty result".
#   4. templates/tool-matrix — filed as `## BL-235:`, deliberately not fixed.
#
# ── WHAT THIS SUITE REFUSES TO DO ───────────────────────────────────────────
# "Do not let a test pass because a fetch or a probe was ATTEMPTED." Not one
# assertion below is satisfied by the presence of a call, a label, or a flag
# that says a thing happened. Every assertion is on EMITTED OUTPUT, LEDGER
# STATE, an EXIT CODE, or WALL-CLOCK TIME.
#
# Three arms are of the kind that silently cannot fire, so each has a test whose
# whole job is to MAKE it fire:
#   • the reference-age fallback  → A3/A4/A6 (fetch fails / never fetched / no remote)
#   • the probe bound             → A5/B6 (a stub that sleeps 30s, wall-clock asserted)
#   • the cannot-tell probe state → B3 (PATH with neither curl nor nc)
# The author of the brief shipped a `docker ps … | head || echo` whose fallback
# could never fire, because a pipeline's status is the last command's. That is
# recorded in `## BL-231:`'s ⚠ CORRECTION block and it is the standard here.
#
# ── Mutation harness standard (all mandatory) ───────────────────────────────
#   • anchored END-OF-LINE markers, asserted at sites==1 in the SHIPPED source;
#   • exactly-N-lines-changed per mutant — this is what catches a sed that
#     reported success and edited nothing (CLAUDE.md's sed trap). The delimiter
#     is `%`, absent from every marker and replacement here, and `&` is escaped
#     because in a sed replacement `&` means THE WHOLE MATCH;
#   • EVERY mutant asserts `bash -n` — a mutant that lands as a syntax error
#     kills every test for the wrong reason and would score as a pass;
#   • mode-preserving (`stat -c || stat -f`, GNU-first);
#   • a FRESH fixture per mutant AND per direction — the freshness detector
#     writes .claude/cache/freshness.json, so a reused project directory carries
#     snooze/cache state from the control run into the mutant run;
#   • structural discriminators for ABSENCES. Item 3 DELETES the phrase half, and
#     an absence cannot be greped for as proof, so M-EMPTY mutates a real shape
#     line back into a phrase match and shows the incident fixture flipping.
#
# Hermetic: temp dirs only. Origins are LOCAL BARE REPOS — never the network,
# never `gh repo create`. No `timeout`/`gtimeout` (absent on the dev host: they
# yield a spurious rc=127, not a timeout). bash 3.2: no ${var,,}, no declare -A,
# no nullglob, no ((x++)) under set -e.
#
# This suite does not invoke init.sh. It EXTRACTS init.sh's Qdrant
# reclassification chain from between its fence markers and executes that, so
# B5 asserts on the shipped chain rather than on a copy of it that could drift.
# `init.sh` is named on executed lines for that reason, so
# lint-tests-registered.sh will mark it unit-lane-exempt; it is registered in
# the tests.yml unit list anyway (the lint treats a listed test as "the
# exemption decided nothing") because it is fast enough for the fast lane.

# ── FIXTURE DIAGNOSTICS — why every git call below is now rc-checked ────────
# Every git call in these fixtures used to be `>/dev/null 2>&1` with no rc
# check. That is this suite's own subject matter living inside the harness
# written to catch it: an exit code thrown away is an exit code that cannot
# testify. It cost a day and four failures wearing one cause.
#
# The cause: `git init --bare` was never told a branch, while the working repo
# one line above it was (`init -q -b main`). So the bare's HEAD follows the
# HOST's `init.defaultBranch` — `master` on an ubuntu-latest runner — while the
# push creates `main`. HEAD is then a DANGLING symref, and `git clone` of such a
# repo prints `warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to
# checkout`, EXITS 0, and leaves a directory with nothing but `.git` in it. The
# `|| return 1` guard saw rc 0; the next line redirected into a `scripts/`
# directory that was never created. This Mac hid it for free: Xcode ships
# /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/gitconfig
# carrying `init.defaultbranch=main`, so the dangling HEAD never happened here.
#
# Reproduce the runner's git on ANY host — this is the command that turned a
# CI-only failure into a local one:
#   GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null \
#     bash tests/test-bl234-currency-and-availability.sh
# H1/H2 below pin both halves so neither can come back silently, and H2 does not
# depend on the host's git config at all.
