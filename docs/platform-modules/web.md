## Scope

This module covers web applications: frontend SPAs, full-stack applications, backend APIs, and static sites deployed to cloud hosting. It addresses both client-rendered (React, Vue, Svelte) and server-rendered (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) architectures.

---

## 1. Architecture Patterns

### 1.1 Framework Selection

| Framework | Language | Rendering | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Next.js** | TypeScript/JavaScript | SSR, SSG, ISR, Client | Full-stack apps with SEO needs, dashboards, SaaS products |
| **React + Vite** | TypeScript/JavaScript | Client-side (SPA) | Internal tools, dashboards, SPAs where SEO doesn't matter |
| **SvelteKit** | TypeScript/JavaScript | SSR, SSG, Client | Performance-focused apps, smaller bundle size |
| **Nuxt** | TypeScript/JavaScript | SSR, SSG, Client | Vue ecosystem. Similar to Next.js. |
| **Express / Fastify** | TypeScript/JavaScript | API only | Backend APIs consumed by separate frontends or mobile apps |
| **FastAPI** | Python | API only | Data-heavy backends, ML integration, Python ecosystem |

**Solo Orchestrator recommendation:** Next.js for full-stack, React + Vite for SPAs, Express/FastAPI for API-only backends. AI generates TypeScript/JavaScript with the highest consistency.

### 1.2 Hosting & Deployment

| Tier | Primary | Alternatives | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Vercel | Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, AWS Amplify | $0-$20/month |
| **Backend** | Railway | Render, Fly.io, AWS App Runner | $5-$20/month |
| **Database** | Supabase | PlanetScale, Neon, self-hosted PostgreSQL | $0-$25/month |
| **Full-stack** | Vercel (Next.js) | Railway (any framework), Render | $0-$20/month |

### 1.3 Database & Auth

**Database:** Supabase (managed PostgreSQL with RLS) for most Solo Orchestrator projects. PostgreSQL via Railway or Neon for projects that don't need Supabase's auth or real-time features.

**Auth:** Supabase Auth, Auth0, Clerk, or enterprise SSO (SAML/OIDC). Selection depends on whether the application needs enterprise SSO integration (see Governance Framework).

**Row Level Security:** PostgreSQL/Supabase support native RLS. Other databases require middleware-based authorization checks.

**Migrations:** Use a versioned migration tool: Prisma (no automatic down migrations — write rollback scripts manually), Knex, Flyway, Alembic (all support automatic up/down).

---

## 2. Tooling

### 2.1 Pre-Build Setup (Web-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide Pre-Build Setup:

**License compliance:**
```bash
# Node.js projects
npm install -g license-checker
# Python projects
pip install pip-licenses
```

**OWASP ZAP (DAST):**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable
```

**Playwright (E2E) — installed per-project in Phase 3:**
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

**Lighthouse (Performance & Accessibility):**
```bash
npm install -g lighthouse
```

### 2.2 Monitoring Accounts

Create accounts now; configure during Phase 4:
- **Sentry:** sentry.io (error tracking)
- **UptimeRobot:** uptimerobot.com (uptime monitoring)
- **PostHog** or **Plausible:** (product analytics)

---

## 3. Build & Packaging

Web applications don't have traditional "packaging" — they're deployed to hosting platforms. The build pipeline produces optimized static assets or a server bundle.

**CI/CD pipeline additions (web-specific):**
```yaml
# Add to the Builder's Guide CI configuration:
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
- name: DAST Scan (Phase 3+)
  run: docker run -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable zap-baseline.py -t $PREVIEW_URL
```

**Bundle optimization:**
```bash
# Next.js
ANALYZE=true npm run build
# Vite
npx vite-bundle-visualizer
```

---

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 E2E Testing

**Tool:** Playwright

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
npx playwright test
```

Automate the full User Journey from the Product Manifesto. Run in CI on every push.

### 4.2 DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

```bash
# Baseline scan (passive — catches common issues)
docker run -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3000

# Active scan (Full Track — more thorough, slower)
docker run -t ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable zap-full-scan.py -t http://localhost:3000
```

Fix anything rated Medium or higher.

**Hardened-serve harness for static apps (BL-165).** A static app's bare preview (`vite preview` over `dist/`) cannot emit the deploy-time host headers — CSP, `X-Frame-Options`, `frame-ancestors`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` — that live at the deploy boundary (documented in Project Bible §11). ZAP baseline correctly flags every missing one as Medium+, so a genuinely clean app **structurally FAILs DAST** with no code change able to fix it. Do not discount the scanner and do not hand-roll an unguided serve. Instead, **declare** the production header set the deploy layer applies, and the Phase-3 validation arm (`scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh`, zap-dast) applies those headers to the responses ZAP judges (via ZAP's Replacer add-on) and rules on the app **as served in production**.

Declare the set in **`.claude/dast-headers.json`** (same `.claude/*.json` machine-readable surface as `tool-preferences.json`):

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none'; base-uri 'none'",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload",
    "Referrer-Policy": "no-referrer"
  }
}
```

- `headers` is a flat name → value map. Header values may contain spaces and quotes (CSP does) — they are passed verbatim, never shell-split.
- **Only non-empty string values are applied.** Entries whose value is not a non-empty string (a number, an empty string, a malformed/non-object `headers`) are ignored; a mixed declaration still engages with just the usable subset (and the evidence records exactly that subset). **If nothing usable remains** — invalid JSON, a non-object or empty `headers`, or no non-empty string value at all — the arm takes the raw-preview path and the verdict note says so plainly (`declaration … present but empty/unparseable — hardening NOT applied`), never silently. An empty-string value is dropped on purpose: it would tell the scanner to *remove* the header, the opposite of hardening.
- The applied config is recorded as durable evidence next to the report (`zap-dast-<timestamp>.hardened-serve.json`) so the pass is auditable — an auditor sees exactly what hardening produced the verdict.
- **This does not soften the gate.** Only the *declared* headers are applied; any other Medium+ alert (XSS, injection, insecure cookie, …) still fails. It is **fail-closed**: if a header cannot be applied, ZAP sees the un-hardened response and the missing-header alert fails the gate — a hardened pass can only arise when the declared headers were really applied.
- **Declare only headers you actually ship.** The declaration is an attestation that the deploy layer sets these headers on every response. Verify it holds against the live site at go-live: `curl -I https://your.app` must show each declared header (see §5.2). If you declare no header dependence, omit the file entirely and the raw-preview FAIL semantics apply unchanged.

### 4.3 Performance & Accessibility

**Lighthouse:**
```bash
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --output html --output-path ./lighthouse-report.html
```

Targets: Accessibility ≥90, Performance ≥90.

**Beyond Lighthouse (Full Track):** Test with a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) and keyboard-only navigation.

### 4.4 Content Security Policy

1. Generate a CSP header. Start with `default-src 'self'`.
2. Deploy in report-only mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) first.
3. Test the full application. Fix violations.
4. Switch to enforcement mode.
5. Document the policy in the Project Bible.

AI-generated CSP policies tend to be too permissive or too restrictive. Test thoroughly.

**Non-inheriting directives (BL-165):** `form-action`, `frame-ancestors`, and `base-uri` do NOT fall back to `default-src` — omit them and they are unrestricted even under `default-src 'none'`. Set all three explicitly (an app with no forms should carry `form-action 'none'`); DAST rule 10055 flags the omission. Note `frame-ancestors` is header-only (ignored in a `<meta>` CSP), which matters on static hosts that cannot set response headers.

Because these headers live at the **deploy boundary** — a static bundle cannot set response headers itself — declare the production CSP (and the other security headers) in `.claude/dast-headers.json` so Phase-3 DAST judges the artifact *as served in production* rather than structurally FAILing the bare preview. See the **hardened-serve harness** under §4.2.

### 4.5 Load Testing (Full Track)

```bash
# macOS
brew install k6

# Windows
winget install k6

# Docker (any platform)
docker pull grafana/k6
```

Define realistic user scenarios. Ramp to expected peak traffic. Identify bottlenecks.

### 4.6 SAST — DOM-XSS sink coverage and its limits (BL-131)

The commit-time SAST gate (the generated `.git/hooks/pre-commit`) and the generated CI both run three semgrep configs: `p/owasp-top-ten`, the registry browser pack `r/javascript.browser.security.insecure-document-method` (innerHTML/outerHTML/`document.write` in **js/ts**, from BL-118), and a **project-owned ruleset shipped at `.semgrep/soif-dom-sinks.yml`** (BL-131). The project-owned ruleset closes the sinks the public registry covers nowhere:

- **js/ts** — `element.insertAdjacentHTML(pos, x)` and jQuery `$(sel).html(x)` (matched precisely via the JS AST; a string-**literal** argument is allowed, so `insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<hr>')` does not trip the gate).
- **`.vue` / `.html`** — `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`, `document.write`/`writeln`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, and jQuery `.html()` inside a `.vue` SFC `<script>` block or an inline `<script>` in a committed `.html`.

**Known residue (accepted, not a bug).** semgrep's `vue` and `html` language parsers do **not** expose the embedded `<script>` JavaScript as a matchable AST (verified against semgrep 1.157.0 — even a bare `location.hash` pattern matches nothing in `vue` mode). The only way to reach those file types is semgrep's **`generic` mode with `pattern-regex`**, which the ruleset uses (scoped to `*.vue`/`*.html`/`*.htm`). Regex matching is **syntactic, not taint-aware**, so two limits follow and are deliberately accepted:

1. **False positives on markup prose.** A `.html` page that *shows* sink code as documentation/example text (e.g. a tutorial containing `el.innerHTML = data`) is flagged even though nothing executes. Suppress a confirmed-safe line with a semgrep inline comment (`// nosemgrep` / `<!-- nosemgrep -->`) or log it in the false-positive register. **Placement is exact: the directive must sit on the SAME line as the finding or on the line IMMEDIATELY above it.** Anything in between — including your own explanation of why the line is safe — silently disables the suppression, and semgrep gives no hint that it was ignored: the commit just stays blocked. Write the explanation *above* the directive, or on the same line after it (`el.innerHTML = SAMPLE; // nosemgrep: literal fixture, not user input`), never between the directive and the flagged line.
2. **Evasion by construction.** A sink assembled across multiple lines, via an aliased method reference (including **bracket notation** — a computed member such as `el["insertAdjacentHTML"]` or `el[method]`, then called with the usual arguments), or by string concatenation that breaks the token pattern can slip past the `.vue`/`.html` regex. The js/ts AST rules are more robust but are still a heuristic (they flag a non-literal argument, not a proven attacker-tainted one), and they too match the dotted call shape rather than a computed-member alias.

The gate is a fast **tripwire**, not a proof of safety: prefer `textContent` / `insertAdjacentText` or an explicit sanitizer (e.g. DOMPurify) for any attacker-influenced markup, and rely on the CSP (§4.4) and code review as the defense-in-depth layers behind it. If semgrep cannot run (absent, offline registry, or a missing `.semgrep/soif-dom-sinks.yml`), the arm WARNs **loudly** ("SAST NOT ENFORCED") rather than passing silently — a not-run scan is never a clean scan.

**What the arm scans, and what "partial" means.** Targets are the **staged blobs** for every added, copied, modified, **renamed** or **type-changed** path (`--diff-filter=ACMRT`) — a rename-and-edit commit is scanned at its *destination*, replacing a symlink with a regular file is scanned as the new file's content, and staged deletions are excluded because a deleted path has no content to scan. If a staged entry cannot be read out of the index (an unreadable object, a path the filesystem cannot express as a temp destination), the arm **scans everything else and reports the gap by name** rather than abandoning the commit's coverage: a finding in the readable subset still **blocks**, and a clean result over a partial set gets the loud "SAST NOT ENFORCED" report — never the `[OK] semgrep: SAST ran on N staged file(s)` receipt. The arm always prints one of those verdicts; silence is never one of its outcomes.

Read that receipt precisely: **it means every blob the filter selected was scanned, and `N` is all of them.** The filter is the boundary of the claim, not a detail beneath it — a status letter missing from `--diff-filter` removes an entry before the scan is even attempted, so nothing is reported as unread and `N` silently counts a subset. That is exactly how a staged **type change** slipped through while the filter was `ACMR`. If you audit this gate, audit the filter letters alongside the receipt; the two are one contract.

**And audit the scanner's own filtering too — that is the third precondition.** Selecting an entry and reading it out of the index still does not mean semgrep *opened* it: semgrep's default `--max-target-bytes` is **1,000,000**, and a target over that is dropped with no error and no non-zero exit. A staged blob one byte too large therefore bought the full `[OK]` receipt while its `innerHTML` sink was never looked at (identical content, only padding differed: 900,037 bytes → blocked, 1,100,032 → committed clean). The arm now passes `--max-target-bytes=0` to disable that filter, **and** — the part that matters more — it reads semgrep's own scan-status line back and refuses the receipt unless the number of targets semgrep reports accepting matches the number it was handed. A shortfall, *or* a scan-status line it cannot parse, routes to the loud "SAST NOT ENFORCED" report naming the staged set; it never falls through to `[OK]`.

**And accepted is not the same as matched, which is the fourth precondition.** Selection is fixed before a byte is parsed and is not touched by what happens next. Semgrep applies a **5-second per-rule, per-file timeout by default**, and a rule that runs out of time is abandoned for that file while the scan still reports success. Measured through the shipped hook on semgrep 1.157.0: a **dense** 1,216,567-byte `.ts` — ordinary generated-bundle-looking code, `tsc` compiles it happily — with `pane.innerHTML = userText` on line 2 reported `Scanning 1 file`, `Targets scanned: 1`, `✅ Scan completed successfully.`, exit 0, and collected the full `[OK]` receipt, deterministically (5/5). The one rule that catches that sink was the rule that timed out. Note the shape that matters: the **same sink under >1MB of comment padding is blocked** — comments are cheap to walk, code is not, so "it is a big file" is not the trigger, "it is a big *dense* file" is. The arm now also reads back semgrep's `Warning: N timeout error(s) in <target> …` line and forfeits the receipt when it appears, naming the target and the exact rule.

So the receipt asserts five things, enforced in five different places: the filter selected every content-bearing staged path, every selected path was read out of the index, the scanner accepted every target it was given, no rule was abandoned part-way through, and no syntax-error warning was seen for what it parsed (the fifth check, below).

**The decode gap is closed by bytes, not by the scanner's word (BL-198).** None of the selection checks asks whether semgrep *decoded* what it accepted, and the check you would reach for first — semgrep's own `Parsed lines: ~N%`, the one number in the summary that reports parse loss — was built and then **withdrawn before shipping**, because on **semgrep ≥ 1.171.0 that number reads `~100.0%` for a file semgrep never decoded** (`--json` is no way around it either — it affirmatively reports such files as scanned; the record is **BL-192**, and it is why no check here trusts a scanner self-report to *grant* anything). What ships instead never consults the scanner: the arm classifies and **transcodes** staged bytes *before* semgrep sees them — an ordinary TypeScript file saved as **UTF-16** (what a Windows editor writes when you pick "Unicode" from the encoding dropdown) is converted to UTF-8 for the scan and the receipt says so — and bytes the arm cannot vouch (NUL-bearing content it cannot attribute, an undecodable blob staged under a source extension) forfeit the receipt by name. One bounded residue is on record: a zero-ASCII, single-line UTF-16 file carries no NUL for the classifier to see and passes through undecoded.

**So do not read `[OK]` as "this commit was scanned in full."** Read it as "the five checks above did not fire." The structural blind spot that remains is the **hard token-stream break** in otherwise ordinary source, and it is now hardened rather than open: a two-line file, `export function r(p){ p.innerHTML = window.name; }` followed by `function ((( broken $$$`, scans clean with zero findings deterministically, while the same sink alone in a well-formed file is blocked — semgrep's parsers are error-recovering, and a recovered parse honestly reports no loss. Since **BL-200** the arm runs semgrep with `--verbose` and reads back its `[WARN] Syntax error at line …` warning: seeing it **forfeits the receipt** (the commit still lands — the detector warns, it does not block) and tells you to fix the syntax error, which your build would have demanded anyway. Know that detector's terms: like the timeout check (**BL-187**), its good case is a warning's *absence*, so a release that respells the warning re-opens the hole silently *in the project* — which is why the framework pins the exact spelling with a canary in its own CI (`tests/test-bl200-syntax-canary.sh`): a respell reds the framework's lane first, and the repair arrives as a framework update. The gate is a tripwire; treat an `[OK]` as "the tripwire did not fire", never as "this commit is safe".

## 5. Deployment & Distribution

### 5.1 Deployment

**Vercel (frontend or full-stack Next.js):**
1. Connect GitHub repository → Import Project → Select repo
2. Configure environment variables with production values
3. Configure custom domain
4. Push to `main` → automatic deployment

**Railway (backend or database):**
1. Connect GitHub repository → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
2. Add managed PostgreSQL if needed
3. Configure environment variables

**Supabase (database & auth):**
1. Create project at supabase.com
2. Push production migration: `npx supabase db push`
3. Configure RLS policies and auth providers
4. Copy production URLs/keys to hosting platform env vars

**Database backup:** Configure daily automated backups. Test restoration.

### 5.1a Releasing — tag deploys and deployment environments

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is **tag-triggered** (`on: push: tags: ['v*']`),
and the framework's documented release action is `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`.

**The trap (walk ISSUE-016).** If your deploy step targets a GitHub deployment
**environment** — `environment: github-pages` on the job, which is what every
GitHub Pages workflow uses — the environment's **deployment branch policy**
decides whether a *tag* may deploy at all. Enabling Pages **auto-creates** a
`github-pages` environment whose default policy admits **the default branch
only**. A tag-triggered run is then rejected by the environment's protection
rules **before any step executes**: the run fails at job setup with an **empty
step list** and no readable error in `gh run view`. Nothing in the workflow can
catch this — a rejected run never starts a job, so an in-workflow preflight step
is unreachable by construction.

**Check it before you tag** (dry run reports; exit 1 means tag deploys would be
rejected):

```bash
scripts/check-gate.sh --release-env-policy          # report
scripts/check-gate.sh --release-env-policy --fix    # apply
```

**The one-line manual equivalent** — admit the release tag pattern:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/OWNER/REPO/environments/github-pages/deployment-branch-policies \
  -f name='v*' -f type='tag'
```

Then re-run the failed workflow. If the environment is set to *protected
branches only*, switch it to custom policies first (the check prints the exact
`gh api -X PUT` for that case). Non-default environment names and tag patterns:
`--env <name>` and `--tag-pattern <glob>`.

This is GitHub-specific. GitLab protected environments and Bitbucket deployment
permissions are opt-in and are not auto-created, so the check reports
NOT APPLICABLE (exit 0) on those hosts.

### 5.2 Go-Live Checklist (Web-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide Phase 4.2:

- [ ] SSL certificate valid
- [ ] Security headers set:
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (from Phase 3)
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] CORS: only allowed origins, no wildcard on authenticated endpoints
- [ ] Cookies: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` flags
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Lighthouse scores meet targets on production URL

### 5.3 Monitoring Setup

**Sentry:**
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs  # or @sentry/[framework]
```
Alert rules: new unhandled exception → email; error rate >2% in 10 min → email + SMS.

**UptimeRobot:**
HTTP(s) monitor on production URL + health check endpoint, 5-minute interval.

---

## 6. Maintenance (Web-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide maintenance cadence:

**Monthly:**
- `npm audit` / `snyk test`
- Review hosting costs against budget
- Verify SSL certificate auto-renewal

**Quarterly:**
- Lighthouse performance audit on production
- Review analytics: user behavior, conversion, error rates
- Check hosting platform for pricing or feature changes

**Biannually:**
- Full Phase 3 security audit re-run
- Framework major version evaluation
- Hosting vendor evaluation (should we migrate?)

### Vulnerability Disclosure

Every production web application MUST include a vulnerability disclosure mechanism:

1. Add a `SECURITY.md` file to the repository with:
   - Supported versions (which releases receive security updates).
   - How to report a vulnerability (email address or security advisory form — not a public issue).
   - Expected response time (acknowledge within 48 hours, assess within 7 days).
   - Safe harbor statement (reporters acting in good faith will not face legal action).
2. Add a `/.well-known/security.txt` route to the web application per RFC 9116, pointing to the disclosure email.
3. For organizational deployments, route reports to the enterprise security team, not the Orchestrator directly.

### Application Sunsetting

When a web application is being decommissioned:

1. **Notify users.** Provide at least 30 days notice via in-app banner and email (if applicable).
2. **Data export.** Provide a self-service data export mechanism before shutdown.
3. **Redirect.** After shutdown, serve a static page explaining the application has been retired and linking to any successor.
4. **DNS and SSL.** Maintain domain ownership and a valid SSL certificate on the redirect page to prevent domain hijacking.
5. **Data deletion.** Delete production databases containing user data per the data retention policy. Document deletion in the APPROVAL_LOG.md.
6. **ITSM closure.** Close the project registration in the enterprise ITSM system.

---

## 7. Phase-Specific Additions

### Phase 1 — Architecture Selection (Append to Core Prompt)

```
WEB-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
11. Frontend framework and rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA)
12. Hosting platform (PaaS preferred)
13. Database and migration tooling
14. Authentication provider and token strategy (JWT vs. sessions)
15. CDN and caching strategy
16. API versioning strategy (if API is consumed externally)
```

### Phase 2 — Project Initialization (Append to Core Steps)

- [ ] `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- [ ] Health check endpoint (`/health`) returning 200
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs

**Python lockfile note:** The `process-checklist.sh --verify-init` script checks for lockfiles to ensure reproducible builds. For Python projects, only `Pipfile.lock` (Pipenv) and `poetry.lock` (Poetry) are detected as valid lockfiles. A plain `requirements.txt` is NOT recognized as a lockfile because it does not guarantee pinned transitive dependencies. If using pip directly, adopt one of these approaches:

- **Recommended:** Use Poetry (`poetry init`, `poetry lock`) or Pipenv (`pipenv install`) to get a proper lockfile.
- **Alternative:** Use `pip-compile` from `pip-tools` to generate a fully-pinned `requirements.txt` from `requirements.in`, then rename or symlink to a recognized lockfile format.

Node.js projects use `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn), both of which are auto-detected.

**Emitted-CI script contract (TypeScript/JavaScript) — BL-159:** The CI pipeline the framework generates for your project runs `npm run lint` and `npm test` unconditionally — and the GitHub lane also runs `npm run build` (its Build step precedes Lint). Your `package.json` MUST define working `lint` and `test` scripts (plus `build` on GitHub) before the first push, or the CI lane fails out of the box (a check that cannot run must not pass — the lane fails loudly rather than silently skipping). Two sharp edges to know:

- **ESLint ≥ 9 requires a flat config file** (`eslint.config.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs`) — the legacy `.eslintrc.*` formats are no longer read by default. A project without a flat config fails `npm run lint` with `ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config.(js|mjs|cjs) file`. Minimal TypeScript starting point: `typescript-eslint`'s `tseslint.config(eslint.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended)`. Verify it is non-vacuous (it must actually flag a planted issue) before trusting the lane.
- **The dependency-audit step is split** (BL-160): the blocking arm runs `npm audit --omit=dev` at the pipeline's audit level — the shipped dependency tree must be clean. Dev-toolchain advisories are reported by a separate loud, non-blocking arm; review them locally with `npm audit` and plan upgrades deliberately (they frequently have no in-major fix).

### Phase 3 — Security (Append to Core Steps)

- [ ] CSP implemented and tested (Step 3.2.5 from previous guide versions)
- [ ] DAST scan completed (ZAP baseline minimum, active for Full Track)
- [ ] SBOM generated: `npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm --output-file sbom.json`

**Platform-specific SAST tools:** Semgrep (referenced in the Builder's Guide) is the primary SAST tool and covers JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python well. For additional coverage, consider ecosystem-specific analyzers:

| Ecosystem | SAST Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TypeScript / JavaScript** | ESLint with `eslint-plugin-security` | Detects unsafe regex, `eval()` usage, non-literal `require()`, and other Node.js security anti-patterns. Add alongside Semgrep for defense in depth. |
| **Python** | Bandit (`pip install bandit`) | Python-specific security linter. Detects hardcoded passwords, use of `eval()`/`exec()`, insecure deserialization, weak cryptography. Run in CI: `bandit -r src/ -ll` (report medium+ severity). |

These complement Semgrep and should run in CI alongside it.

### Phase 4 — Release & Maintenance (Append to Core Steps)

The Builder's Guide Phase 4 baseline (mechanically tracked by `scripts/process-checklist.sh --start-phase4`) enumerates six steps: `production_build`, `rollback_tested`, `go_live_verified`, `monitoring_configured`, `handoff_written`, `handoff_tested`. Web platform deliverables for each:

- [ ] **`production_build`** — Vercel "Production" deployment for frontend / full-stack Next.js (verify the build log shows the prod environment + prod env vars, NOT the preview/staging environment); Railway "Deploy" against the production service for backend; Supabase "Production" project for database. Tag the release commit (`git tag -s vX.Y.Z`) so the deployment is reproducible.
- [ ] **`rollback_tested`** — Exercise the documented rollback path BEFORE go-live, not after the first incident. Procedure depends on hosting:
  - **Vercel:** Deployments → previous successful deployment → "Promote to Production" (instant — Vercel keeps prior immutable deployments). Time the promotion and verify production traffic now hits the rolled-back build.
  - **Railway:** Re-deploy from the prior Git tag (`git checkout vX.Y.(Z-1) && railway up`) OR use Railway's per-service "Redeploy" against a prior deployment. Verify env vars and DB connection on the rolled-back build.
  - **Database migrations:** dry-run the down-migration on a staging copy (`npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back …` for Prisma without auto-down; `knex migrate:rollback` for Knex; etc.). If a migration is destructive (drops a column, drops a table), document an explicit data-restore script — automated rollback cannot recover deleted user data.
  - Save evidence at `docs/test-results/[YYYY-MM-DD]_rollback-test.md` covering: which deploy was promoted, wall-clock duration of the rollback, production verification (URL + smoke-test result + log excerpt), and an explicit Light/Standard+/Full Track scope statement (Light = manual Vercel/Railway promote + smoke; Standard+ = automated rollback script under `scripts/rollback.sh`; Full = chaos-style scheduled rollback drill, archived as a separate test session).
- [ ] **`go_live_verified`** — Walk the §5.2 Go-Live Checklist on the PRODUCTION URL (not preview). SSL valid; security headers present (run `curl -I https://your.app` and assert `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`); CORS not wildcarded on authenticated endpoints; cookies carry `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite`; rate-limit on `/auth/*`; Lighthouse run against the production URL meets the §4.3 targets (Accessibility ≥ 90, Performance ≥ 90).
- [ ] **`monitoring_configured`** — Sentry release set to the deployed tag (`@sentry/cli releases new vX.Y.Z && releases finalize vX.Y.Z`) so errors are correlated to the deploy; alert rules per §5.3 active and tested (trigger a deliberate error in a non-prod build and confirm the email/SMS fires); UptimeRobot HTTP(S) monitor on `https://your.app/health` at the 5-minute interval; PostHog or Plausible page-load event flowing from the production URL.
- [ ] **`handoff_written`** — `docs/HANDOFF.md` populated from `templates/generated/handoff.tmpl`. Web-specific sections that MUST be filled (not left as placeholder): hosting-platform login / billing-owner, custom-domain registrar + DNS-record list with TTLs, env-var inventory grouped by deploy environment (preview vs. production), database-backup retention policy + restore procedure with last-tested date, monitoring tool URLs + on-call contact, vulnerability-disclosure inbox per §6 "Vulnerability Disclosure".
- [ ] **`handoff_tested`** — A second operator (or the same operator after a deliberate 24-hour cooldown to defeat fresh-memory bias) executes `docs/HANDOFF.md` end-to-end on a clean machine: log into Vercel, log into Railway, log into Supabase, pull the latest tag, run a fresh deploy to a preview environment, restore one database backup to a scratch DB, simulate one alert. Any step that required tribal knowledge not in the doc gets captured as a HANDOFF.md fix in the same session.

**Incident response template:** `templates/generated/incident-response.tmpl` is included in the standard init scaffold and should be customized at this phase. The web-specific addition: link the template's "Detection" section to your Sentry alert URLs and the "Mitigation" section to the rollback procedure documented under `rollback_tested`.

**Release notes:** `templates/generated/release-notes.tmpl` covers the user-visible summary. For web apps, append a "Browser support" line (especially when changing minimum browser versions) and a "Database migration" line indicating whether the release requires a down-migration window.
