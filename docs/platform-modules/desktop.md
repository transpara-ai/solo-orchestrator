## Scope

This module covers desktop applications distributed as installable or portable executables for Windows, macOS, and/or Linux. It addresses two architectural patterns:

- **Standalone:** Self-contained applications with local data storage. No server dependency. Fully offline-capable.
- **Client-Server:** Desktop application that communicates with a backend service (local or remote) for data sync, user accounts, or shared resources.

This module is referenced from the Builder's Guide at `⟁ PLATFORM MODULE` callout points. Follow the Builder's Guide for methodology; follow this module for platform-specific implementation.

## 1. Architecture Patterns

### 1.1 Framework Selection

Desktop applications require a framework that provides: a native window shell, access to OS-level APIs (file system, system tray, native dialogs, notifications), and a packaging/distribution pipeline. The major options:

| Framework | Language | Binary Size | Performance | OS API Access | Learning Curve | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tauri** | Rust (backend) + HTML/CSS/JS (frontend) | 5-15 MB | Excellent — native webview, Rust backend | Full via Rust | Steep if no Rust experience. Frontend is standard web tech. | Performance-critical, small binary, security-focused apps |
| **Electron** | JavaScript/TypeScript (full stack) | 100-200 MB | Good — Chromium + Node.js | Full via Node.js | Low if you know JS/TS | Feature-rich apps where binary size is acceptable, rapid development |
| **Flutter Desktop** | Dart | 20-40 MB | Good — compiled native | Moderate — via plugins | Moderate | Cross-platform with mobile (shared codebase) |
| **.NET MAUI** | C# | 30-60 MB | Good — native controls | Full via .NET | Moderate if you know C# | Windows-primary with macOS/Linux secondary |
| **Qt** | C++ or Python (PyQt/PySide) | 30-80 MB | Excellent — native rendering | Full | Steep (C++) / Moderate (Python) | High-performance, complex UIs, industrial applications |

**Solo Orchestrator recommendation for AI-directed development:**

- **If binary size and performance are priorities:** Tauri. The Rust backend is harder for AI to generate correctly, but the frontend is standard web tech. AI handles the frontend well; scrutinize the Rust backend more carefully.
- **If development speed is the priority and binary size is acceptable:** Electron. AI generates JavaScript/TypeScript with the highest consistency. Largest community, most examples in training data.
- **If you're also building mobile:** Flutter Desktop. Shared codebase across desktop and mobile is a genuine advantage, but Flutter desktop support is less mature than mobile.

**For the Competency Matrix:** If the selected framework uses a language the Orchestrator marked "No" for validation, automated testing coverage must be higher (>80% minimum) and the AI's output in that language needs more manual review during the Build Loop.

### 1.2 Architecture Decision: Standalone vs. Client-Server

| Consideration | Standalone | Client-Server |
|---|---|---|
| **Data location** | Local file system, embedded database (SQLite), or application state | Local cache + remote database/API |
| **Offline capability** | Full — no network dependency | Partial — core features offline, sync when connected |
| **User accounts** | None or local-only profiles | Server-managed auth (OAuth, SSO, custom) |
| **Multi-device sync** | Not applicable | Requires sync strategy (conflict resolution, merge logic) |
| **Deployment** | Ship the binary, done | Ship the binary + deploy/maintain the server |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Significantly higher — two systems to build and maintain |

**For client-server applications:** The server component follows the Web Platform Module for its architecture. This module covers the desktop client. The builder maintains two codebases (or a monorepo with two build targets).

### 1.3 Data Storage Options

| Option | Use Case | Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLite (embedded)** | Structured data, queryable, ACID transactions | Best default for standalone apps. Ships with the application. No server needed. |
| **File system (direct)** | Document-centric apps (editors, viewers, creative tools) | Application reads/writes user files directly. No database layer. |
| **LevelDB / RocksDB** | Key-value storage, high write throughput | Embedded, no server. Good for caching, session state. |
| **JSON/YAML config files** | Application settings, user preferences | Keep it simple. Don't use for large datasets. |
| **Remote database via API** | Client-server architecture | Desktop client calls API; database lives on server. |

For applications using SQLite: use a migration tool (such as `better-sqlite3` with manual migrations for Node.js, or `sqlx` with migrations for Rust) to version data model changes.

### 1.4 Auto-Update Strategy

Users of desktop applications do not automatically get the latest version. Plan for updates:

| Strategy | Implementation | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework-native updater** | Tauri: built-in updater. Electron: `electron-updater`. | Simplest. Checks for updates on launch, downloads in background. |
| **.NET MAUI updates** | MSIX via Microsoft Store (auto-update managed by Store), WinGet package (update via `winget upgrade`), or manual download from release page. MAUI does not include a built-in updater — choose an external mechanism. | Store distribution handles updates automatically but requires Store onboarding. WinGet and manual download require users to act. |
| **Manual download** | User downloads new version from website/release page | No infrastructure needed. Users must actively update. Acceptable for MVP. |
| **Package manager** | Homebrew (macOS), winget/Chocolatey (Windows), apt/snap/flatpak (Linux) | Leverages existing update infrastructure. More setup for the builder. |
| **No auto-update** | Versioned releases only | Simplest. Acceptable for Light Track and early MVPs. |

**MVP recommendation:** Start with manual download (GitHub Releases or direct download page). Add auto-update post-MVP once the product stabilizes.

## 2. Tooling

### 2.1 Pre-Build Setup (Platform-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide Pre-Build Setup:

**Tauri:**
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update stable
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli
# Platform prerequisites:
# macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install)
# Linux: sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file \
#   libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
# Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, WebView2 (pre-installed on Windows 11)
```

**Electron:**
```bash
# Node.js 20+ required (Node 22 LTS recommended; Node 18 reached end of life April 2025)
npm install --save-dev electron electron-builder
# No additional platform-specific prerequisites
```

**Flutter Desktop:**
```bash
# Install Flutter SDK
# https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
flutter doctor  # Verify desktop support for your platforms
flutter config --enable-[windows|macos|linux]-desktop
```

**Qt / PySide6 / PyQt6 (Python desktop):**

Python desktop projects have a version compatibility chain that must be established during Phase 1 architecture and locked before Phase 2 construction begins. Each library constrains the others:

```
Python version (floor)
  → PySide6 or PyQt6 (requires Python 3.9+; PySide6 6.7+ requires 3.9+)
    → VTK (if used: VTK 9.3+ requires Python 3.9+, wheels available for 3.9-3.12)
      → NumPy, SciPy, etc. (each has its own Python floor)
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Pin the Python version with pyenv
pyenv install 3.12.7   # or whichever version satisfies all library constraints
pyenv local 3.12.7     # creates .python-version in project root

# 2. Create a virtual environment (venv, not conda — simpler CI story)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# 3. Pin dependencies with exact versions
pip install PySide6==6.7.3 vtk==9.3.1
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Document the chain in the Project Bible (Section 10: Coding Standards):** Record the Python floor version, why that version was chosen (which library is the binding constraint), and which libraries are incompatible with newer Python versions. When Python releases a new minor version, the chain must be re-validated — do not blindly upgrade.

**CI note:** Use `actions/setup-python` with the exact version from `.python-version`. Do not use `3.x` or `>=3.9` — floating version specs cause CI failures when a new Python release breaks a library's native extensions.

**.NET MAUI:**
```bash
# Install .NET SDK 8.0+ (LTS)
# https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
dotnet workload install maui
dotnet new maui -n MyApp
```

### 2.2 License Compliance Tooling

Depends on your ecosystem:

| Ecosystem | Tool | Install | CI Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** (Electron, Tauri frontend) | `license-checker` | `npm install -g license-checker` | `license-checker --failOn "GPL-2.0;GPL-3.0;AGPL-3.0"` |
| **Rust** (Tauri backend) | `cargo-license` | `cargo install cargo-license` | `cargo license --avoid-build-deps --avoid-dev-deps` (review output) |
| **Python** (PyQt/PySide) | `pip-licenses` | `pip install pip-licenses` | `pip-licenses --fail-on="GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2);GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3);GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)"` |
| **Dart** (Flutter) | `dart_license_checker` | `dart pub global activate dart_license_checker` | `dart pub global run dart_license_checker --fail-on "GPL-2.0,GPL-3.0,AGPL-3.0"` |
| **C#** (.NET MAUI) | `dotnet-project-licenses` | `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-project-licenses` | `dotnet-project-licenses --input . --fail-on "GPL-2.0-only;GPL-3.0-only;AGPL-3.0-only"` |

Both direct and transitive dependencies must be checked.

## 3. Build & Packaging

### 3.1 Cross-Platform Build Matrix

Configure CI to build on all target platforms. Most desktop frameworks require building ON the target platform (cross-compilation is possible but fragile).

**GitHub Actions example (Tauri):**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: windows-latest
        target: windows
      - os: macos-latest
        target: macos
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        target: linux
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

**GitHub Actions example (Electron):**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [windows-latest, macos-latest, ubuntu-latest]
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  - run: npm ci
  - run: npx electron-builder --publish never
```

### 3.2 Packaging Formats

| Platform | Format | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `.msi` (installer) or `.exe` (NSIS installer) or portable `.exe` | electron-builder, tauri bundler, WiX (MSI) |
| **macOS** | `.dmg` (disk image) or `.app` bundle | electron-builder, tauri bundler, `create-dmg` |
| **Linux** | `.AppImage` (portable), `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora), Flatpak, Snap | electron-builder, tauri bundler, `appimagetool`, platform-specific tools |

**MVP recommendation:** `.exe` installer (Windows) + `.dmg` (macOS) + `.AppImage` (Linux). These cover the broadest user base with the least packaging complexity.

### 3.3 Code Signing

Unsigned applications trigger security warnings on Windows (SmartScreen) and macOS (Gatekeeper). For MVP/Light Track, this is acceptable with documentation. For Standard+ Track, code signing is required for credible distribution.

| Platform | Certificate Source | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | EV Code Signing Certificate (DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.) | $200-$500/year | EV eliminates SmartScreen warnings. Standard certificates reduce but don't eliminate them. |
| **macOS** | Apple Developer Program | $99/year | Required for notarization. Without it, users must bypass Gatekeeper manually. |
| **Linux** | GPG signing | Free | Sign packages and checksums. Less critical for user trust, more for package manager distribution. |

**CI integration:** Code signing should happen in CI, not on the developer's machine. Store signing certificates as CI secrets.

### 3.4 Binary Size Optimization

| Framework | Typical Size | Optimization |
|---|---|---|
| **Tauri** | 5-15 MB | Already small. `cargo build --release` with LTO. Strip debug symbols. |
| **Electron** | 100-200 MB | Use `electron-builder` with ASAR packaging. Exclude unnecessary files. Consider `electron-packager` with `--prune`. |
| **Flutter** | 20-40 MB | `flutter build [platform] --release`. Tree-shaking is automatic. |
| **Qt/PySide6** | 80-150 MB | Use `--standalone` mode in your chosen packager. Exclude unused Qt modules (`QtWebEngine` alone is ~80 MB). |
| **.NET MAUI** | 30-60 MB | Publish as single-file with trimming: `dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true`. |

**Packaging warning — Python desktop apps with scientific/visualization libraries (VTK, NumPy, SciPy, etc.):**

Python packagers (Nuitka, PyInstaller, cx_Freeze) must discover all transitive imports at build time. Libraries with complex lazy-loading — VTK in particular — cause three recurring problems:

1. **Missing modules at runtime.** VTK uses `vtkmodules` with hundreds of lazy-loaded sub-modules that the packager's static analysis misses. You will get `ModuleNotFoundError` on the user's machine even though the app works in your dev environment. Fix: explicit include flags (`--include-package=vtkmodules` for Nuitka, `--hidden-import` for PyInstaller) or a comprehensive hook file.
2. **Extreme bundle sizes.** VTK's shared libraries can push the bundle to 500 MB+. There is no tree-shaking for native `.so`/`.dll` files — you ship all of VTK even if you use one renderer. Budget for this in your packaging format choice (`.AppImage` and `.dmg` tolerate large bundles better than `.msi`).
3. **Platform-specific build failures.** Nuitka compiles Python to C, then to native code. VTK's C++ extensions interact poorly with this pipeline on some platforms. PyInstaller's binary-bundling approach is more reliable for VTK but produces larger bundles. Test the packaged binary on a clean machine (no Python installed) early in Phase 2 — do not defer packaging validation to Phase 3.

**Recommendation for PySide6+VTK projects:** Use PyInstaller with a `.spec` file that explicitly lists VTK hidden imports. Run `pyinstaller --collect-all vtkmodules` as a starting point, then prune. Validate the packaged binary on a clean VM before each Phase 2 feature is considered complete.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Integration/E2E Testing

| Framework | E2E Testing Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Tauri** | WebDriver (via `tauri-driver`) or Playwright (webview content) | `tauri-driver` provides WebDriver protocol. Playwright can test the web content inside the webview. |
| **Electron** | Playwright (`electron` launch option) or Spectron (deprecated — use Playwright) | Playwright has first-class Electron support: `const app = await electron.launch({ args: ['main.js'] })` |
| **Flutter** | `integration_test` package | Built-in. `flutter test integration_test/` |
| **.NET MAUI** | Appium or WinAppDriver (Windows) | Less mature than web E2E testing. May require platform-specific test suites. |

**Minimum E2E coverage:** Automate the complete User Journey (Phase 0 Success Path) on at least one platform. Run manually on the others for MVP. Full automation on all platforms for Standard+ Track.

### 4.2 Platform-Specific Testing Checklist

Run on each target platform before release:

**All platforms:**
- [ ] Application launches without errors
- [ ] Core user journey completes
- [ ] File system operations work (open, save, create, delete as needed)
- [ ] Application handles missing/corrupt data files gracefully
- [ ] Memory usage is stable over extended use (no leaks)
- [ ] Application closes cleanly (no orphaned processes)

**Windows-specific:**
- [ ] Works on Windows 10 and Windows 11
- [ ] Handles high-DPI displays correctly
- [ ] Installer registers uninstaller in Add/Remove Programs
- [ ] File associations work (if applicable)
- [ ] Application doesn't require admin privileges for normal operation

**macOS-specific:**
- [ ] Works on the minimum supported macOS version
- [ ] Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon (universal binary or separate builds)
- [ ] Retina display rendering is correct
- [ ] Application menu bar follows macOS conventions (About, Preferences, Quit)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works (if applicable)
- [ ] Notarization passes (Standard+ Track)

**Linux-specific:**
- [ ] Works on Ubuntu (Debian-based) and at least one other distro (Fedora, Arch)
- [ ] Wayland and X11 compatibility (or document which is required)
- [ ] Correct permissions — doesn't require root for normal operation
- [ ] System tray integration works (if applicable)
- [ ] Font rendering is acceptable across distros

### 4.3 Accessibility Testing

Desktop accessibility APIs vary by platform:

| Platform | Accessibility API | Testing Tool | Minimum Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | UI Automation / MSAA | Accessibility Insights for Windows (free, Microsoft) | Run automated scan + manual keyboard navigation test |
| **macOS** | NSAccessibility | Accessibility Inspector (included in Xcode) | Run VoiceOver on primary user journey |
| **Linux** | AT-SPI | Accerciser (GNOME) | Verify Orca screen reader reads primary controls |
| **Web-based UI (Tauri/Electron)** | ARIA + platform bridge | axe-core, Lighthouse (on webview content) | Run axe-core scan + keyboard navigation test |

For Tauri and Electron: the web content is testable with standard web accessibility tools. The native shell (menus, dialogs, system tray) needs platform-specific testing.

### 4.4 Performance Testing

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|---|---|---|
| **Cold start time** | <3 seconds on minimum supported hardware | Time from launch to interactive UI |
| **File open time** | Scales linearly with file size; large files (<500 pages, <100MB) open in <5 seconds | Benchmark with representative files |
| **Memory usage (idle)** | <200 MB base, scaling linearly with open documents | OS task manager / process monitor during extended use |
| **Memory leaks** | Zero — stable memory after open/close cycles | Open and close documents repeatedly; memory should return to baseline |
| **Rendering performance** | Smooth scrolling, no visual lag | Manual testing with large/complex documents |

### 4.5 Security Checks (Desktop-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide Phase 3.2 security hardening:

- [ ] **No elevated privileges:** Application does not request or require admin/root for normal operation
- [ ] **Safe file handling:** Path traversal protection on all file operations. Validate file paths before read/write. Don't follow symlinks outside expected directories.
- [ ] **IPC security (if using):** Inter-process communication channels are authenticated and validated. Tauri: configure `allowlist` / CSP for IPC commands. Electron: validate all IPC messages in main process.
- [ ] **Webview isolation (Tauri/Electron):** Webview content cannot execute arbitrary Node.js/Rust code. Context isolation enabled. `nodeIntegration: false` (Electron). Tauri: commands exposed via `#[tauri::command]` only.
- [ ] **Auto-updater security (if using):** Update downloads are signed and verified. HTTPS only. Certificate pinning recommended.
- [ ] **Local data protection:** Sensitive local data (credentials, tokens) stored using OS keychain (Keytar, macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager) — not plain text config files.

**Platform-specific SAST tools:** Semgrep (referenced in the Builder's Guide) covers JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. For other desktop ecosystems, add platform-specific static analysis:

| Ecosystem | SAST Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **.NET / C# (MAUI, WPF)** | Roslyn analyzers (built-in), Security Code Scan | Security Code Scan is a Roslyn analyzer NuGet package that detects SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and other OWASP Top 10 issues in C# code. Enable via `dotnet add package SecurityCodeScan.VS2019`. |
| **Java / Kotlin (desktop)** | SpotBugs, Find Security Bugs | Find Security Bugs is a SpotBugs plugin focused on security. Add to Gradle: `spotbugs { toolVersion = '4.x' }` with `spotbugsPlugins 'com.h3xstream.findsecbugs:findsecbugs-plugin:1.x'`. |
| **Rust (Tauri backend)** | `cargo audit`, `cargo clippy` | `cargo audit` checks dependencies for known vulnerabilities. `cargo clippy` catches common mistakes including some security-relevant patterns. Both should run in CI. |

These complement Semgrep — they catch language-specific issues that a polyglot SAST tool may miss.

### Rate Limiting (Client-Server Desktop Apps)

For desktop applications with a backend API:

- Apply rate limiting on all API endpoints (authentication, data access, file uploads).
- Use token bucket or sliding window algorithms.
- Return `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header.
- Rate limit by user/session, not by IP (desktop apps may share corporate IPs via VPN/NAT).

For standalone desktop applications with no backend: rate limiting is not applicable.

### Vulnerability Disclosure

Every production desktop application MUST include a vulnerability disclosure mechanism:

1. Add a `SECURITY.md` file to the repository with:
   - Supported versions (which releases receive security updates).
   - How to report a vulnerability (email address or security advisory form — not a public issue).
   - Expected response time (acknowledge within 48 hours, assess within 7 days).
   - Safe harbor statement (reporters acting in good faith will not face legal action).
2. Reference the `SECURITY.md` in the application's About screen or documentation.
3. For organizational deployments, route reports to the enterprise security team, not the Orchestrator directly.

## 5. Distribution

### 5.1 Distribution Channels

| Channel | Effort | Reach | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Releases** | Low | Developers, technical users | GitHub account. Free. Attach binaries to tagged releases. |
| **Direct download (website)** | Low-Medium | General users | Hosting for download page. Link to files hosted on GitHub Releases or CDN. |
| **Homebrew Cask (macOS)** | Medium | macOS users who use Homebrew | Create a Cask formula. Submit to homebrew-cask repo or maintain a custom tap. |
| **winget (Windows)** | Medium | Windows 10+ users | Create a manifest. Submit to winget-pkgs repo. |
| **Snap Store (Linux)** | Medium | Ubuntu and Snap-enabled distros | Create a snapcraft.yaml. `snapcraft` build tool. |
| **Flathub (Linux)** | Medium | Linux users across distros | Create a Flatpak manifest. Submit to Flathub. |
| **Microsoft Store** | High | Windows users | MSIX packaging. Store submission process. $19 one-time registration. |
| **Mac App Store** | High | macOS users | Sandboxing requirements. $99/year Apple Developer Program. Notarization. |

**MVP recommendation:** GitHub Releases + direct download page. Add package managers (Homebrew, winget) post-MVP. App stores are Full Track territory.

### 5.2 Release Process

1. Tag the release in Git: `git tag -s v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0 - Initial release"`
2. CI builds on all platforms, runs full test suite, runs security scans
3. CI creates platform-specific packages
4. CI signs packages (if code signing configured)
5. CI uploads artifacts to GitHub Releases (or equivalent)
6. Generate checksums for all artifacts: `sha256sum *.{exe,dmg,AppImage}`
7. Publish release notes (from CHANGELOG.md)
8. Verify download and install on each platform (manual smoke test)

### 5.3 Rollback Procedure and Rollback Test

Unlike a web app, you cannot "promote previous deployment" with one click — desktop releases are pulled from multiple immutable distribution surfaces. Plan the rollback as a deliberate procedure and exercise it BEFORE the first release goes out (the Phase 4 `rollback_tested` step is mandatory and fails if no evidence file exists).

#### Channel-specific withdraw / yank steps

| Channel | Withdraw step | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Releases** | Edit the bad release → "Set as pre-release" or delete (and re-tag if needed). Delete the corresponding Git tag (`git push --delete origin vBAD; git tag -d vBAD`). | Cached download URLs may persist; rely on the updater feed (below) to actually pull users back. |
| **Homebrew (Cask or tap)** | Open a PR against `homebrew-cask` (or your custom tap) reverting the formula to the previous version. | Users on `brew upgrade` automation pick up the revert on their next run; explicit `brew install <cask>@<oldver>` for impacted users. |
| **winget** | Open a PR against `microsoft/winget-pkgs` removing or reverting the offending manifest version. | `winget upgrade` will then offer the prior version. Users on the bad version must `winget install --version <oldver>`. |
| **Snap Store** | `snapcraft release <name> <oldrev> stable` to roll the `stable` channel pointer to the prior revision; optionally `snapcraft close stable` to halt new installs while you decide. | The Snap daemon refreshes installed snaps automatically; rollback propagates within hours. |
| **Flathub** | Submit a revert PR to `flathub/<appid>` reverting the manifest; Flathub rebuilds and republishes. | Slower than Snap (CI rebuild time); use `flatpak update` to pull. |
| **Microsoft Store / Mac App Store** | Submit the prior version's package as a "rollback" submission. Store review delays apply (1-3 days). | For severe issues, also contact store support to expedite or temporarily delist. |
| **Direct download** | Update the download page to link the prior installer; remove the bad installer from the CDN. | Add a banner on the download page describing the rollback so support inbox isn't flooded. |

#### Auto-updater feed rollback (Tauri / Electron)

The auto-updater feed is the highest-leverage rollback surface — change one JSON/YAML file and every running installation downgrades on its next check.

- **Tauri (`updater.json`):** Point `version` back to the prior tag, regenerate the per-platform `signature` and `url` fields against the prior signed artifacts. The Tauri updater (since 1.x) accepts downgrades when the served version is lower than the installed one IF the user-shipped config sets `"endpoints"` to an updater URL you control AND the downgrade is signed by your release key.
- **electron-updater (`latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, `latest-linux.yml`):** Replace the per-platform YAML files with copies from the prior release's artifacts (the published `latest*.yml` files are part of the release assets). Set `allowDowngrade: true` in `package.json`'s `build` block (or the equivalent `electron-builder` config) — the default forbids downgrades silently. After deploy, run `electron-updater`'s `checkForUpdates()` on a test install to confirm the rolled-back version is served.
- **Sparkle (legacy macOS Electron via custom feed):** revert the `appcast.xml` `<enclosure>` URL + version + signature triple to the prior release; the daemon refreshes within the update-check interval.

If you ship without an auto-updater (Light Track / MVP via direct download), the only rollback surface is the manual channels above + a clear advisory on the website's download page.

#### Rollback test by track tier

The `rollback_tested` step exercises what the rollback path actually does — file the evidence at `docs/test-results/[YYYY-MM-DD]_rollback-test.md` and reference it from the Phase 4 checklist closeout.

- **Light Track (manual download, no auto-updater):** Install the current shipped version on a clean OS image (or VM snapshot). Use the application briefly to populate local data. Uninstall via the platform's standard mechanism (Add/Remove Programs on Windows, drag to Trash on macOS, `apt remove` / `snap remove` on Linux). Install the prior version. Verify (a) user data created with the current version is still readable, (b) settings persist, (c) the prior version doesn't refuse to load files with a future schema (or, if it does, the error message tells the user how to recover). Test on at least one OS per platform you ship to.
- **Standard+ Track (auto-updater configured):** All Light Track steps PLUS: publish a "rollback" updater feed pointing at the prior version on a staging/canary URL, run two installs of the current version (one on each of two OS platforms — Windows + macOS minimum), point both at the canary feed, trigger an update check, and verify both installs downgrade to the prior version without manual intervention. Time the downgrade and record it in the evidence file. Confirm `electron-updater` / Tauri updater logs show the downgrade was signature-verified.
- **Full Track (chaos / scheduled rollback drill):** All Standard+ steps PLUS a quarterly scheduled drill that exercises the production updater feed against a canary cohort (1-5% of installations). Drill must include: a deliberate rollback issued against the canary, a verification that production fleet is unaffected, and a roll-forward back to the latest version once the canary cohort confirms recovery. Archive each drill in `docs/test-results/`.

#### Data-loss safety during rollback

The auto-updater MUST NOT delete user data during downgrade. Validate this in the rollback test by creating recognizable test data with the current version BEFORE downgrading, then asserting the data is intact (and ideally readable) after the rollback. If a release changed a local-DB schema in a non-backward-compatible way, the rollback test surfaces that as a [BLOCKER] — schema changes need a one-way feature flag or a deliberate "data migration on next launch" path that survives a downgrade.

### Data Handling on Uninstall

Define and document what happens to user data when the application is uninstalled:

- **Windows (NSIS/MSI installer):** The uninstaller removes application binaries but SHOULD NOT delete user data in `%APPDATA%` unless the user explicitly opts in during uninstall.
- **macOS (.dmg/.app):** Dragging to Trash removes the app bundle only. Document the location of preferences (`~/Library/Application Support/[AppName]`) and provide a "Remove All Data" option in the app's settings.
- **Linux (AppImage/deb/rpm):** Package uninstall removes binaries. Document config file locations (`~/.config/[appname]`, `~/.local/share/[appname]`) in the README or man page.

For applications storing sensitive data locally (credentials, personal documents), provide an in-app "Secure Delete" or "Wipe Data" feature that overwrites files before deletion.

## 6. Maintenance (Desktop-Specific)

In addition to the Builder's Guide maintenance cadence:

**Monthly:**
- Check for OS deprecation notices that affect the application (minimum supported OS version, deprecated APIs)
- Verify the application still builds on all platforms (OS and SDK updates can break builds)

**Quarterly:**
- Review platform-specific user feedback (Windows vs. macOS vs. Linux issues)
- Test on the latest OS versions (new macOS/Windows releases, new Ubuntu LTS)

**Biannually:**
- Evaluate minimum supported OS version — dropping old versions reduces maintenance burden
- Review framework updates (Tauri, Electron, Flutter major versions) for migration path
- Renew code signing certificates before expiration
- Re-run the §5.3 rollback test against the current shipped version (drift detection — channel APIs, updater feed formats, and OS uninstaller behavior change over time)

### Monitoring & Error Tracking

Desktop applications lack server-side observability by default. Configure the following before launch:

| Tool | Purpose | Free Tier |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Sentry** | Crash reporting, error tracking | 5K errors/month |
| **PostHog** | Usage analytics (opt-in) | 1M events/month |
| **Built-in telemetry** | Framework-specific crash reporting | N/A |

**Minimum viable monitoring:**

1. Integrate Sentry (or equivalent) for unhandled exceptions and crash reports.
2. Configure alert rules: new crash type → email notification; crash rate spike → SMS/Slack.
3. For client-server apps: add health check endpoint monitoring (UptimeRobot or equivalent) on the backend.
4. Test the monitoring integration by triggering a deliberate error in a non-production build.

**Privacy:** If collecting telemetry or crash reports, disclose this in the application's About/Settings screen and provide an opt-out mechanism. Comply with the privacy requirements in the Governance Framework.

### Backup & Data Recovery

Desktop applications store data locally. Users expect their data to survive application updates and crashes.

1. **SQLite databases:** Use WAL mode for crash resilience. Document the database file location for each OS in HANDOFF.md.
2. **Application settings:** Store in OS-standard locations (AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS, ~/.config on Linux). Never store in the application binary directory.
3. **User data export:** Provide a data export mechanism (JSON or CSV) for applications storing user-created content. This is both a user feature and a disaster recovery tool.
4. **Update safety:** Test that application updates preserve existing databases and configuration files. The auto-updater MUST NOT delete user data.
5. **Backup testing:** Before launch, verify: (a) uninstall preserves user data in the default OS locations, (b) reinstall reconnects to existing data, (c) exported data can be re-imported.

## 7. Phase-Specific Checklists

### Phase 1 — Architecture Selection (Append to Core Prompt)

Add these requirements to the Builder's Guide Step 1.2 architecture prompt:

```
DESKTOP-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
11. UI Framework: Tauri, Electron, Flutter Desktop, or other — with
    justification based on binary size, performance, and development
    speed requirements.
12. Local data storage strategy: SQLite, file system, or other —
    justified by the data contracts.
13. Cross-platform build strategy: How does CI build for all target
    platforms? Are there platform-specific code paths?
14. Packaging format per platform: installer type, portable option.
15. Code signing strategy: required or deferred? Certificate source.
16. Auto-update mechanism: built-in, manual, or deferred to post-MVP.
17. OS integration: system tray, file associations, native dialogs,
    notifications — which are MVP and which are post-MVP?
18. IPC security model (Tauri/Electron): how does the frontend
    communicate with the backend process? What commands are exposed?
19. Offline-first or connected: does the app require network for
    any core functionality?
20. Minimum supported OS versions per platform.
```

### Phase 2 — Project Initialization (Append to Core Steps)

After the Builder's Guide Project Initialization steps:

- [ ] Cross-platform build configuration verified (builds on all target platforms from CI)
- [ ] Platform-specific code paths identified and documented (e.g., `#[cfg(target_os)]` in Rust, `process.platform` in Node.js)
- [ ] Native dialog integration working (file open/save dialogs at minimum)
- [ ] Application icon configured for all platforms
- [ ] Window management working (resize, minimize, maximize, close)

**Dependency lockfile note (Java/Gradle projects):** The `process-checklist.sh --verify-init` script checks for lockfiles to ensure reproducible builds. Java/Gradle projects use `gradle.lockfile` (generated via `./gradlew dependencies --write-locks`) or `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` (generated via `./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256`). Enable dependency locking in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencyLocking {
    lockAllConfigurations()
}
```

Without a lockfile, the init verification check will flag the project. Node.js projects (Electron, Tauri frontend) use `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`, which are auto-generated.

### Phase 3 — Go-Live Verification (Append to Core Checklist)

After the Builder's Guide Phase 4.2 go-live checklist:

- [ ] Installer/package installs correctly on each platform
- [ ] Application launches from installed location (not just dev environment)
- [ ] Uninstaller works cleanly (Windows)
- [ ] File associations work (if applicable)
- [ ] Code signing verified — no security warnings on install (Standard+ Track)
- [ ] Auto-update works (if implemented)
- [ ] Checksums published for all download artifacts

## Appendix: Tauri vs. Electron Quick Decision

| If you need... | Choose |
|---|---|
| Smallest binary size (<20 MB) | Tauri |
| Fastest development with JS/TS throughout | Electron |
| Best runtime performance and memory usage | Tauri |
| Largest ecosystem of desktop-specific packages | Electron |
| Strong security isolation by default | Tauri (Rust backend, webview isolation, command allowlist) |
| AI generates code most consistently for this framework | Electron (JS/TS has the most training data) |
| Cross-platform with mobile (shared codebase) | Flutter Desktop |
| The Orchestrator has no Rust experience and binary size is acceptable | Electron |
| The Orchestrator has no Rust experience but binary size matters | Tauri (the frontend is still web tech; the Rust backend is mostly auto-generated by the framework) |
