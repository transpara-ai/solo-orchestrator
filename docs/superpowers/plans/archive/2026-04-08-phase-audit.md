# Enterprise Process Audit — Implementation Plan

> **Archived 2026-07-05 (BL-049):** Shipped via commit `e52295a` ("audit: enterprise process audit — 6 reports + consolidated summary", 2026-04-08); reports live under `Reports/phase-audits/`. Still read as a live fixture by `tests/test-specs-plans-remaining-quartet.sh` — do not delete. See `docs/superpowers/plans/archive/README.md` for the archive convention.

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Execute a comprehensive enterprise process audit of all 5 phases + cross-cutting infrastructure, producing 6 audit reports and 1 consolidated summary.

**Architecture:** Dispatch 6 parallel research agents, each reading framework files through an enterprise persona lens and producing a standardized audit report. After all complete, consolidate into a master report with de-duplicated remediation and verification plans.

**Tech Stack:** Agent tool (research-only agents), Write tool for reports, Bash for directory creation and git operations.

---

### Task 1: Create output directory

**Files:**
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/` (directory)

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the reports directory**

Run:
```bash
mkdir -p Reports/phase-audits
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify directory exists**

Run:
```bash
ls -d Reports/phase-audits
```
Expected: `Reports/phase-audits`

---

### Task 2: Dispatch all 6 audit agents in parallel

**Files:**
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-0-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-1-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-2-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-3-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-4-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-cross-cutting-audit.md`

All 6 agents MUST be dispatched in a single message (6 Agent tool calls in parallel). Each agent is research-only — it reads files and returns its complete report as text. After each agent returns, write its report to the corresponding file.

Each agent receives:
1. Its persona and scope
2. The complete report template (exact Markdown structure to follow)
3. The 12-point evaluation rubric
4. The exact file paths to read
5. The key evaluation questions for its phase
6. Instructions to be exhaustive and to flag (but not evaluate) cross-cutting concerns

The full agent prompts are specified in Steps 1–6 below. **All 6 steps execute in parallel.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Dispatch Phase 0 Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of a Product Management Director. Your evaluation mindset: "Can a PM with no framework experience follow this process and produce consistent, reviewable artifacts?"

You are auditing Phase 0 (Product Discovery) of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0. This framework guides AI-directed software development from concept to production.

## Your Scope
Steps 0.1–0.7 and the Phase 0→1 gate. Specifically:
- Step 0.1: Functional Feature Set (FRD)
- Step 0.2: User Personas & Interaction Flow (User Journey)
- Step 0.3: Data Input/Output & State Logic (Data Contract)
- Step 0.4: Product Manifesto & MVP Cutline
- Step 0.5: Revenue Model & Unit Economics (Standard+ Track only)
- Step 0.6: Orchestrator Competency Matrix
- Step 0.7: Trademark & Legal Pre-Check (Standard+ Track only)
- Phase 0→1 Gate (approval mechanism)

## Files to Read
Read ALL of these files thoroughly:
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/docs/builders-guide.md — read the Phase 0 section (from "Phase 0: Product Discovery" through the Phase 0→1 gate)
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/docs/user-guide.md — read the Phase 0 section
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/docs/governance-framework.md — read the Pre-Phase 0 pre-conditions and Phase 0→1 gate sections
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/templates/generated/product-manifesto.tmpl
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/templates/project-intake.md
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/templates/generated/approval-log-org.tmpl
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/templates/generated/approval-log-personal.tmpl

## Tier-Tuple Pre-Audit Gating (Mandatory)

BEFORE grading any finding, compute the project's tier tuple
(deployment, poc_mode, track, enforcement_level) and cross-reference
the graceful-degradation baseline:

1. Read `.claude/phase-state.json` for `.deployment`, `.poc_mode`,
   `.track`. Read `.claude/manifest.json` for `.enforcement_level`.
   If a field is missing, fall back to `manifest.json` for
   deployment/poc_mode and treat enforcement_level as `strict`.
2. Cross-reference `.audit-baseline-v2.md` §6 (Intentional Graceful
   Degradation) and §7 (Cross-Tier Behavior Matrix). A behavior that
   LOOKS like a gap may be an intentional carve-out for the project's
   tier tuple (e.g. branch protection skipped on `deployment=personal`,
   Phase 3 SAST skipped on `track=light`). If the baseline file is
   missing, note this in §1 Scope and proceed treating all tiers as
   strict.
3. Every finding row in §2 MUST include a **tier_context** field
   stating which tier combinations the finding applies to. Example
   values: `applies to all tiers` | `organizational + strict only` |
   `personal — graceful degradation, NOT a gap`. A finding without
   `tier_context` is malformed and will be rejected during
   consolidation. Use the new severity flag `tier_misalignment` for
   findings where the bug is divergence from expected tier-tuple
   behavior rather than absence of behavior.

Record the computed tier tuple in §1 Scope & Methodology of your
report.

## Evaluation Rubric
For EVERY prescribed action in Phase 0, evaluate against these 12 criteria:
1. Instructions — Is there a clear, unambiguous instruction? Can someone new follow it?
2. Input Requirements — Are prerequisites and inputs defined?
3. Output Specification — Is the output defined — format, structure, required content, storage location, filename?
4. Template/Guide — If it produces a document, is there a template? If it runs a tool, is there a guide?
5. Storage & Retention — Where does the output live? Is the location canonical?
6. Enforcement Mechanism — What prevents skipping? Tier 1 (CI), Tier 2 (hook/script), Tier 3 (LLM compliance)? Should it be higher?
7. Validation/Verification — After the step is done, how do you verify it was done correctly?
8. Error Handling — What happens when this step fails? Is there documented recovery?
9. Audit Trail — Is there evidence this step was completed? Can a third party verify it?
10. Sign-off Authority — Who approves? Where recorded? What constitutes approval?
11. Traceability — Can you trace from requirement → implementation → validation → release?
12. Bypass Risk — Can the step be circumvented? Is the bypass detectable?

Mark criteria as "N/A" with a reason when they don't apply — never skip silently.

## Key Evaluation Questions
- Can someone produce a consistent PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md from the intake alone?
- Are the FRD, User Journey, and Data Contract outputs defined well enough to be reviewed by a third party?
- Is the MVP Cutline mechanism enforceable or just advisory?
- Does the Competency Matrix actually gate CI tool installation, or is it just a self-assessment?
- How does the Phase 0→1 gate work mechanically? Where is the approval stored? What constitutes sufficient approval?
- Are evaluation prompt results stored anywhere, or do they vanish with the session?

## Report Format
Produce your report in EXACTLY this Markdown structure:

# Phase 0 Process Audit Report
## Product Discovery

**Auditor Persona:** Product Management Director
**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Framework Version:** Solo Orchestrator v1.0 (post-PR #6, #7)
**Files Evaluated:** [list every file you read]

---

## 1. Scope & Methodology
[What you evaluated, enterprise benchmark (ISO 9001 / SOC 2 Type II process maturity), what questions drove the evaluation]

## 2. Findings

For each finding use this EXACT format:

### Finding P0-NNN: [Title]
- **Severity:** Critical | Major | Minor | Observation | tier_misalignment
- **Category:** Missing Template | Missing Enforcement | Missing Documentation | Missing Storage | Missing Validation | Workflow Gap | Audit Trail Gap | Bypass Risk
- **tier_context:** [REQUIRED — see Tier-Tuple Pre-Audit Gating; e.g. "applies to all tiers" | "organizational + strict only" | "personal — graceful degradation, NOT a gap"]
- **Evidence:** [file:line or "not found"]
- **Enterprise Expectation:** [What a production software company would require]
- **Current State:** [What the framework actually does]
- **Gap:** [Specific delta]
- **Impact:** [What goes wrong if not fixed]

Number findings sequentially: P0-001, P0-002, etc.

Severity definitions:
- Critical: Process cannot be followed as written, or compliance-critical gap
- Major: Process works but produces inconsistent/unverifiable results
- Minor: Gap exists but workaround is obvious or impact is low
- Observation: Not a gap but an improvement opportunity
- tier_misalignment: Framework behavior diverges from the expected behavior for this project's tier tuple (e.g. branch protection fires on personal deployment, or strict mode auto-relaxes)

## 3. Remediation Plan

| ID | Finding | Fix Description | Files to Create/Modify | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|---------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|

## 4. Verification Test Plan

| ID | Test | Method | Expected Result |
|----|------|--------|----------------|

## 5. Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | N |
| Major | N |
| Minor | N |
| Observation | N |

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|

Be exhaustive. If you notice cross-cutting infrastructure issues (scripts missing docs, hooks that can be bypassed), note them briefly as "Cross-cutting concern — CC auditor should evaluate: [description]" but do not produce findings for them.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Dispatch Phase 1 Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of an Enterprise Architect. Your evaluation mindset: "Would I sign off on this architecture process for a production system my team will maintain?"

You are auditing Phase 1 (Architecture & Technical Planning) of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0.

## Your Scope
Steps 1.1–1.6 and the Phase 1→2 gate. Specifically:
- Step 1.1: Business Strategy Gateway (Standard+ Track)
- Step 1.1.5: Market Signal Validation (Standard+ Track)
- Step 1.2: Architecture & Stack Selection (3 options, 10 decision categories)
- Step 1.3: Threat Model & Stress Test (STRIDE analysis)
- Step 1.4: Data Model specification
- Step 1.4.5: Data Migration Plan (if replacing existing system)
- Step 1.5: UI & UX Scaffolding
- Step 1.6: The Project Bible (16 required sections)
- Phase 1→2 Gate (Senior Technical Authority approval for org)

## Evaluation Rubric
For EVERY prescribed action in Phase 1, evaluate against these 12 criteria:
1. Instructions — Is there a clear, unambiguous instruction? Can someone new follow it?
2. Input Requirements — Are prerequisites and inputs defined?
3. Output Specification — Is the output defined — format, structure, required content, storage location, filename?
4. Template/Guide — If it produces a document, is there a template? If it runs a tool, is there a guide?

12. Bypass Risk — Can the step be circumvented? Is the bypass detectable?

Mark criteria as "N/A" with a reason when they don't apply — never skip silently.

## Key Evaluation Questions
- Are the three architecture options required at Step 1.2 evaluated against a defined rubric, or is selection purely subjective?
- Is the STRIDE threat model output structured enough to be validated in Phase 3.2? Can you trace from a Phase 1 threat to a Phase 3 validation result?
- Does the Project Bible template cover all 16 required sections? Are freshness markers mechanical or advisory?
- Where are rejected architecture alternatives stored for audit trail purposes?
- What happens if the Phase 1→2 gate is denied? Is there a documented rework path?
- How does the governance framework's "Senior Technical Authority" role work for personal/light-track projects that don't have one?

## Report Format
Use EXACTLY the same format as specified (see Phase 0 prompt for full template). Use finding IDs P1-001, P1-002, etc.

Be exhaustive. Flag cross-cutting concerns for the CC auditor but don't produce findings for them.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Dispatch Phase 2 Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of an Engineering Manager. Your evaluation mindset: "Can my team execute this build process and will the audit trail satisfy our compliance department?"

You are auditing Phase 2 (Construction) of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0.

## Your Scope
- Project Initialization (7 steps: remote repo, branch protection, scaffolding, data model, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, verification checklist)
- The Build Loop per feature (Steps 2.2–2.6: Write Tests → Implement → Security Audit → Documentation → Data Model Changes)
- UAT Testing (Step 2.7), Bug Triage (Step 2.8), Remediation (Step 2.9)
- Context Health Check (every 3-4 features)
- Mid-Phase 2 Governance Checkpoint (organizational)

Mark criteria as "N/A" with a reason when they don't apply — never skip silently.

## Key Evaluation Questions
- Does the Build Loop enforcement (process-checklist.sh) actually prevent out-of-order steps? What about edge cases (partial commits, force push, amend)?
- When a security audit (Step 2.4) finds issues, where are the findings stored? Is there a record that they were resolved before the commit proceeded?
- UAT session results: is there a defined archive structure? Can you trace from a UAT finding to a bug in BUGS.md to a fix commit to a re-test result?
- The mid-phase governance checkpoint for org deployments — what artifact does it produce? Where is the review outcome recorded?
- How does the Phase 2→3 gate verify that ALL MVP features were built? Is there a mechanical check or just attestation?
- The Context Health Check — is it enforceable or just a reminder? If the Bible is stale, does anything block?

## Report Format
Use EXACTLY the same format as specified. Use finding IDs P2-001, P2-002, etc.

Be exhaustive. This is the largest phase — expect the most findings. Flag cross-cutting concerns for the CC auditor but don't produce findings for them.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Dispatch Phase 3 Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of a Head of Quality Assurance. Your evaluation mindset: "Does every test type have clear entry/exit criteria, results storage, and sign-off authority?"

You are auditing Phase 3 (Validation, Security & UAT) of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0.

## Your Scope
- Step 3.1: Integration Testing (E2E suite)
- Step 3.2: Security Hardening (SAST, dependency scan, secret scan, license, SBOM, threat model validation, false positive handling)
- Step 3.3: Chaos & Edge-Case Testing
- Step 3.4: UX & Accessibility Audit (WCAG AA, screen reader, keyboard, color-blind personas)
- Step 3.5: Performance Audit
- Step 3.5.5: Contract Testing (Standard+ Track)
- Step 3.5.7: Load/Stress Testing (Full Track)
- Step 3.5.9: Test Results Archive
- Step 3.6: Pre-Launch Preparation (analytics, final UAT, user docs, legal, distribution)
- Phase 3 Remediation table
- Phase 3→4 Gate

## Tier-Tuple Pre-Audit Gating (Mandatory)

BEFORE grading any finding, compute the project's tier tuple
(deployment, poc_mode, track, enforcement_level) and cross-reference
the graceful-degradation baseline:

1. Read `.claude/phase-state.json` for `.deployment`, `.poc_mode`,
   `.track`. Read `.claude/manifest.json` for `.enforcement_level`.
   If a field is missing, fall back to `manifest.json` for
   deployment/poc_mode and treat enforcement_level as `strict`.
2. Cross-reference `.audit-baseline-v2.md` §6 (Intentional Graceful
   Degradation) and §7 (Cross-Tier Behavior Matrix). A behavior that
   LOOKS like a gap may be an intentional carve-out for the project's
   tier tuple (e.g. branch protection skipped on `deployment=personal`,
   Phase 3 SAST skipped on `track=light`). If the baseline file is
   missing, note this in §1 Scope and proceed treating all tiers as
   strict.
3. Every finding row in §2 MUST include a **tier_context** field
   stating which tier combinations the finding applies to. Example
   values: `applies to all tiers` | `organizational + strict only` |
   `personal — graceful degradation, NOT a gap`. A finding without
   `tier_context` is malformed and will be rejected during
   consolidation. Use the new severity flag `tier_misalignment` for
   findings where the bug is divergence from expected tier-tuple
   behavior rather than absence of behavior.

Record the computed tier tuple in §1 Scope & Methodology of your
report.

## Evaluation Rubric
For EVERY prescribed action in Phase 3, evaluate against these 12 criteria:
1. Instructions — Is there a clear, unambiguous instruction? Can someone new follow it?
2. Input Requirements — Are prerequisites and inputs defined?
3. Output Specification — Is the output defined — format, structure, required content, storage location, filename?
4. Template/Guide — If it produces a document, is there a template? If it runs a tool, is there a guide?
5. Storage & Retention — Where does the output live? Is the location canonical?
6. Enforcement Mechanism — What prevents skipping? Tier 1 (CI), Tier 2 (hook/script), Tier 3 (LLM compliance)? Should it be higher?
7. Validation/Verification — After the step is done, how do you verify it was done correctly?
8. Error Handling — What happens when this step fails? Is there documented recovery?
9. Audit Trail — Is there evidence this step was completed? Can a third party verify it?
10. Sign-off Authority — Who approves? Where recorded? What constitutes approval?
11. Traceability — Can you trace from requirement → implementation → validation → release?
12. Bypass Risk — Can the step be circumvented? Is the bypass detectable?

Mark criteria as "N/A" with a reason when they don't apply — never skip silently.

## Key Evaluation Questions
- For each of the 7 validation types (integration, security, chaos, accessibility, performance, contract, results archiving): where are results stored? What format? What constitutes pass/fail? Who signs off?
- Threat model validation in Step 3.2 — how does the agent prove it validated every Phase 1.3 threat vector? Is there a checklist that maps threats to mitigations to test results?
- False positive handling — the process says "document in Phase 3 audit notes." Where exactly are these notes? Is there a template?
- SBOM generation — where is it stored? Is there a freshness check? The framework says "regenerated monthly" but is there any enforcement?
- The Phase 3→4 gate requires "go-live approval(s)." For org deployments, this includes IT Security. Where is IT Security's approval recorded? What format? Same APPROVAL_LOG.md or separate?
- Step 3.6 mandates attorney review of Privacy Policy and ToS. How is this tracked? Where is the attorney's sign-off recorded? What if skipped?

## Report Format
Use EXACTLY the same format as specified. Use finding IDs P3-001, P3-002, etc.

Be exhaustive. Flag cross-cutting concerns for the CC auditor but don't produce findings for them.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Dispatch Phase 4 Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of a VP of Operations / SRE Lead. Your evaluation mindset: "Can I deploy, roll back, monitor, maintain, and hand off this system with zero tribal knowledge?"

You are auditing Phase 4 (Release & Maintenance) of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0.

## Your Scope
- Step 4.1: Production Build & Distribution (build verification, deployment strategy)
- Step 4.1.5: Rollback & Incident Response Playbook (INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md, severity classification, mandatory rollback test)
- Step 4.2: Go-Live Verification (manual checklist, RELEASE_NOTES.md)

## Tier-Tuple Pre-Audit Gating (Mandatory)

BEFORE grading any finding, compute the project's tier tuple
(deployment, poc_mode, track, enforcement_level) and cross-reference
the graceful-degradation baseline:

1. Read `.claude/phase-state.json` for `.deployment`, `.poc_mode`,
   `.track`. Read `.claude/manifest.json` for `.enforcement_level`.
   If a field is missing, fall back to `manifest.json` for
   deployment/poc_mode and treat enforcement_level as `strict`.
2. Cross-reference `.audit-baseline-v2.md` §6 (Intentional Graceful
   Degradation) and §7 (Cross-Tier Behavior Matrix). A behavior that
   LOOKS like a gap may be an intentional carve-out for the project's
   tier tuple (e.g. branch protection skipped on `deployment=personal`,
   Phase 3 SAST skipped on `track=light`). If the baseline file is
   missing, note this in §1 Scope and proceed treating all tiers as
   strict.
3. Every finding row in §2 MUST include a **tier_context** field
   stating which tier combinations the finding applies to. Example
   values: `applies to all tiers` | `organizational + strict only` |
   `personal — graceful degradation, NOT a gap`. A finding without
   `tier_context` is malformed and will be rejected during
   consolidation. Use the new severity flag `tier_misalignment` for
   findings where the bug is divergence from expected tier-tuple
   behavior rather than absence of behavior.

Record the computed tier tuple in §1 Scope & Methodology of your
report.

## Evaluation Rubric
For EVERY prescribed action in Phase 4, evaluate against these 12 criteria:
1. Instructions — Is there a clear, unambiguous instruction? Can someone new follow it?
2. Input Requirements — Are prerequisites and inputs defined?
3. Output Specification — Is the output defined — format, structure, required content, storage location, filename?
4. Template/Guide — If it produces a document, is there a template? If it runs a tool, is there a guide?
5. Storage & Retention — Where does the output live? Is the location canonical?
6. Enforcement Mechanism — What prevents skipping? Tier 1 (CI), Tier 2 (hook/script), Tier 3 (LLM compliance)? Should it be higher?
7. Validation/Verification — After the step is done, how do you verify it was done correctly?
8. Error Handling — What happens when this step fails? Is there documented recovery?
9. Audit Trail — Is there evidence this step was completed? Can a third party verify it?
10. Sign-off Authority — Who approves? Where recorded? What constitutes approval?
11. Traceability — Can you trace from requirement → implementation → validation → release?
12. Bypass Risk — Can the step be circumvented? Is the bypass detectable?

Mark criteria as "N/A" with a reason when they don't apply — never skip silently.

## Key Evaluation Questions
- Rollback testing is mandatory — but where is the test result recorded? How does the system verify rollback was tested before go-live?
- The incident response playbook — does the template cover all severity levels with concrete procedures? After an actual incident, where is the post-mortem stored?
- Go-live verification is a manual checklist — how is completion recorded? APPROVAL_LOG.md? Separate sign-off?
- Monitoring setup (Step 4.3) — how does the framework verify error tracking is actually configured and capturing events?
- Maintenance cadence (monthly/quarterly/biannual) — is there any scheduling or reminder mechanism?
- Handoff test — where are the test results stored? What happens if the test fails?
- SECURITY.md — only for web/desktop. What triggers creation? Template? Enforcement?

## Report Format
Use EXACTLY the same format as specified. Use finding IDs P4-001, P4-002, etc.

Be exhaustive. Flag cross-cutting concerns for the CC auditor but don't produce findings for them.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Dispatch Cross-Cutting Auditor**

Dispatch an Agent with this prompt:

```
You are an Enterprise Process Auditor with the persona of a Chief Compliance Officer. Your evaluation mindset: "Does the mechanical infrastructure actually enforce what the docs promise? Where can someone bypass the system?"

You are auditing the cross-cutting infrastructure and governance mechanics of the Solo Orchestrator Framework v1.0.

## Your Scope
- All scripts in scripts/ — documentation, prerequisites, error handling, discoverability
- init.sh — what it creates, what it misses, structural completeness
- Hook system — registration, bypass risks, coverage gaps
- CI/CD pipeline templates — do they enforce what the docs promise?
- Governance framework — signoff mechanics, tamper evidence, approval tracking
- Upgrade paths — track upgrade, deployment upgrade, POC→production readiness checks
- Evaluation prompt system — result storage, completion tracking, skip detection
- Enforcement model — relationship between what docs promise and what code delivers
- Cross-document consistency — user-guide vs builders-guide vs governance-framework

## Files to Read
Read ALL of these files thoroughly:
- /Users/karl/Documents/Claude Projects/solo-orchestrator/scripts/ — read EVERY script: check-changelog.sh, check-phase-gate.sh, check-session-state.sh, check-updates.sh, check-versions.sh, intake-wizard.sh, pre-commit-gate.sh, process-checklist.sh, reconfigure-project.sh, resolve-tools.sh, resume.sh, session-end-qdrant-reminder.sh, session-test-gate-check.sh, session-version-check.sh, test-gate.sh, track-tool-usage.sh, upgrade-project.sh, validate.sh, verify-install.sh, lib/helpers.sh

## Tier-Tuple Pre-Audit Gating (Mandatory)

BEFORE grading any finding, compute the project's tier tuple
(deployment, poc_mode, track, enforcement_level) and cross-reference
the graceful-degradation baseline:

1. Read `.claude/phase-state.json` for `.deployment`, `.poc_mode`,
   `.track`. Read `.claude/manifest.json` for `.enforcement_level`.
   If a field is missing, fall back to `manifest.json` for
   deployment/poc_mode and treat enforcement_level as `strict`.
2. Cross-reference `.audit-baseline-v2.md` §6 (Intentional Graceful
   Degradation) and §7 (Cross-Tier Behavior Matrix). A behavior that
   LOOKS like a gap may be an intentional carve-out for the project's
   tier tuple (e.g. branch protection skipped on `deployment=personal`,
   Phase 3 SAST skipped on `track=light`). If the baseline file is
   missing, note this in §1 Scope and proceed treating all tiers as
   strict.
3. Every finding row in §2 MUST include a **tier_context** field
   stating which tier combinations the finding applies to. Example
   values: `applies to all tiers` | `organizational + strict only` |
   `personal — graceful degradation, NOT a gap`. A finding without
   `tier_context` is malformed and will be rejected during
   consolidation. Use the new severity flag `tier_misalignment` for
   findings where the bug is divergence from expected tier-tuple
   behavior rather than absence of behavior.

Record the computed tier tuple in §1 Scope & Methodology of your
report.

## Evaluation Rubric
For EVERY script, hook, CI check, governance mechanism, and infrastructure component, evaluate against these 12 criteria:
1. Instructions — Is there a clear, unambiguous instruction? Can someone new follow it?
2. Input Requirements — Are prerequisites and inputs defined?
3. Output Specification — Is the output defined — format, structure, required content, storage location, filename?
4. Template/Guide — If it produces a document, is there a template? If it runs a tool, is there a guide?
5. Storage & Retention — Where does the output live? Is the location canonical?
6. Enforcement Mechanism — What prevents skipping? Tier 1 (CI), Tier 2 (hook/script), Tier 3 (LLM compliance)? Should it be higher?
7. Validation/Verification — After the step is done, how do you verify it was done correctly?
8. Error Handling — What happens when this step fails? Is there documented recovery?
9. Audit Trail — Is there evidence this step was completed? Can a third party verify it?
10. Sign-off Authority — Who approves? Where recorded? What constitutes approval?
11. Traceability — Can you trace from requirement → implementation → validation → release?
12. Bypass Risk — Can the step be circumvented? Is the bypass detectable?

## Key Evaluation Questions
- For every script: is there documentation explaining what it does, prerequisites, expected outputs, and error handling? Can someone troubleshoot a failure without reading the source?
- Hook bypass risks: what commands bypass the PreToolUse hooks? (Known issue: `gh repo create --push` bypasses branch-safety.sh. Are there others?)
- The evaluation prompt system — when prompts are run, where are results stored? Is there a mechanism to track that all required reviews were performed? Can someone skip a review?
- Governance signoff mechanics: APPROVAL_LOG.md is append-only — but what prevents editing previous entries? Is there tamper evidence beyond git history? What constitutes a valid signoff?
- Upgrade paths: does the upgrade script verify new requirements are met, or just add governance overhead without checking readiness?
- validate.sh — does it cover all structural requirements init.sh creates? If init.sh adds process-state.json, does validate.sh check for it?
- Are user-guide.md and builders-guide.md consistent with each other?
- CI pipeline templates — do they include all checks the framework promises (SAST, dependency audit, license, lockfile, phase gate, changelog, session state)? For all supported languages?

## Report Format
Use EXACTLY the same format as specified. Use finding IDs CC-001, CC-002, etc.

Be the most exhaustive of all 6 auditors. You are the one who catches what falls through the cracks between phases.
```

### Task 3: Write audit reports to files

After all 6 agents return, write each report to its file.

**Files:**
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-0-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-1-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-2-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-3-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-4-audit.md`
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-cross-cutting-audit.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write Phase 0 audit report**

Write the Phase 0 agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-0-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write Phase 1 audit report**

Write the Phase 1 agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-1-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write Phase 2 audit report**

Write the Phase 2 agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-2-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write Phase 3 audit report**

Write the Phase 3 agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-3-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write Phase 4 audit report**

Write the Phase 4 agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-phase-4-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write Cross-Cutting audit report**

Write the Cross-Cutting agent's complete output to `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-cross-cutting-audit.md`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify all 6 reports written**

Run:
```bash
ls -la Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-*.md | wc -l
```
Expected: `6`

Run:
```bash
for f in Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-*-audit.md; do echo "$f: $(grep -c '^### Finding' "$f") findings"; done
```
Expected: Each file shows a non-zero finding count.

---

### Task 4: Produce consolidated summary

**Files:**
- Read: All 6 audit reports
- Create: `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-consolidated-summary.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read all 6 reports and extract findings**

Read each report. Extract every finding ID, severity, category, title, and remediation item into a working list.

- [ ] **Step 2: Identify cross-auditor duplicates**

Look for findings that describe the same gap from different phase perspectives. Common patterns to check:
- "Evaluation prompt results not stored" — may appear in P0, P1, P3, CC
- "No template for X" — may appear in multiple phase audits
- "Missing audit trail for Y" — may appear in the phase audit and CC audit

Merge duplicates: keep all source finding IDs, use the most specific description, take the highest severity.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the consolidated summary**

Write `Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-consolidated-summary.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Enterprise Process Audit — Consolidated Summary

**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Framework Version:** Solo Orchestrator v1.0 (post-PR #6, #7)
**Auditors:** Phase 0 (PM Director), Phase 1 (Enterprise Architect), Phase 2 (Engineering Manager), Phase 3 (QA Head), Phase 4 (VP Ops), Cross-Cutting (CCO)

```bash
ls -la Reports/phase-audits/2026-04-08-consolidated-summary.md
```
Expected: File exists with substantial content.

Run:
