## Purpose

This guide walks you through using the Solo Orchestrator Framework from first setup to production maintenance. It covers what you do, when, and why — with separate paths for personal projects and organizational deployments.

For what the framework *is*, how it works at a conceptual level, and what it is not suited for, see the [README](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator#readme). This guide assumes you have read that and decided to proceed.

**What you actually need open:** This guide, your project's `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`, and your [Platform Module](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator/tree/main/docs/platform-modules). Everything else is reference material — the table above tells you when each document becomes relevant.

**How to read this guide:** Follow it step by step. Read the section for your current step, do the step, then read the next section. You do not need to read this guide end-to-end before starting. Each section tells you exactly what to do, what the AI agent does, and what to review before moving on.

**Prefer asking over reading?** All framework documents are designed to be machine-readable. Load the project's `docs/` directory into your AI assistant and ask it questions about the framework's capabilities, limitations, or procedures. The documents contain enough structured context for any capable AI to answer accurately.

## 1. Before You Start

### What This Framework Is

A structured methodology for a single experienced technologist to build MVP-quality applications with a clear path to production, using AI as the execution layer. You define intent, constraints, and validation. The AI generates architecture, code, tests, and documentation within those constraints. It is phase-gated, test-driven, and security-scanned at every step. The output is a functional, tested, security-scanned MVP — production deployment requires additional hardening, operational readiness, and (for organizational projects) governance completion. See the [README](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator#readme) for the full overview.

### What You Should Know Before You Start

**AI-generated code IP:** Software built using this framework is generated in part by AI. The copyright status of AI-generated code is legally unsettled under current U.S. and international law. The framework's human-directed phase gates strengthen copyright claims but do not guarantee protection. Do not assume full copyright protection for AI-generated code without consulting qualified IP counsel. See the [README Legal Notices](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator#legal-notices) for the full disclosure.

**AI-generated legal documents:** Any Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, or other legal documents produced during the build process must be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before deployment.

### What This Framework Expects of You

You are a technically literate person who can navigate a terminal, use Git, read code, and run command-line tools. The AI writes the code. You make every decision, validate every output, and gate every phase transition.

This is not a tool for learning to program. If you cannot look at AI-generated code and determine whether it is roughly correct, the framework's quality controls will not compensate for that gap.

#### Self-Assessment Checklist

Before starting, confirm you can do the following. If more than 2 items are unfamiliar, invest time learning them first.

- [ ] Navigate a terminal: `cd`, `ls`, run commands, read output
- [ ] Basic Git: clone a repo, make commits, push, create branches
- [ ] Understand what a test is and interpret pass/fail output
- [ ] Read code well enough to spot obvious problems (wrong variable, missing check, hardcoded secret)
- [ ] Edit JSON and YAML files without breaking their syntax
- [ ] Understand what an API is and how HTTP request/response works (for web projects)
- [ ] Install software from the command line (npm, pip, brew, apt, or equivalent)
- [ ] Read a stack trace or error message and identify the relevant line

### What Is Enforced vs. What Is Guided

The framework has three tiers of control, plus an intermediate tier for CI-based warnings. Understanding which tier a rule falls into tells you where the safety nets are — and where you are the safety net.

**Before the tier breakdown — your project's enforcement level matters.** Solo Orchestrator projects ship with one of three enforcement levels (`strict` / `light` / `no`), set at `init.sh` time and changeable later via `scripts/reconfigure-project.sh --enforcement-level`. The level controls **how aggressively the framework treats user-terminal git commits**:

| Level | User-terminal commits | `--no-verify` behavior | Default for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `strict` | Blocked in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (framework-gate.sh) when they violate the Build Loop / Phase classifier | Bypass-able at commit time, but **the next SessionStart hook records the commit to `.claude/bypass-audit.json`** — you can route around the block, you cannot route around the audit trail | All projects (default) |
| `light` | Allowed at commit time | Allowed at commit time; commit is still recorded by the SessionStart out-of-band detector | Personal exploration projects that explicitly opt in |
| `no` | Allowed at commit time | Allowed at commit time; **not** recorded | Personal projects that opt in AND accept losing the W7 successor-handoff narrative |

**Tier semantics (baseline §2.5):** `strict` is forced for organizational projects in Sponsored POC or Production mode. Personal projects and organizational/Private POC projects are "choosable" — they can pick any of the three levels.

**Files:**
- The project's level lives in `.claude/manifest.json::.enforcement_level`.
- The strict-mode block hook is `.git/hooks/framework-gate.sh` (installed/uninstalled by `scripts/install-filesystem-gates.sh` on level transitions).
- The audit log is `.claude/bypass-audit.json`. Every user-terminal commit captured by the detector appears as a row with `type: "out_of_band_commit"`; every framework-gate block appears as `type: "terminal_commit_blocked"`. A clean pass through the gate writes **no** ledger row — only a non-tracked `.claude/last-gate-pass.txt` receipt — so the tracked ledger records real events only (BL-161); `terminal_commit_passed` is a legacy type that historical ledgers may still contain. For the full row schema, per-type lifecycle, and cold-pickup successor jq recipes, see `docs/audit-log-lifecycle.md`.

**Operator commands:**
- `bash init.sh --non-interactive ... --enforcement-level <no|light|strict> [--confirm-pitfalls]` — set at project creation (`--confirm-pitfalls` is required to go below strict).
- `bash scripts/reconfigure-project.sh --enforcement-level <no|light|strict> [--confirm-pitfalls]` — transition an existing project (refused for tiers that force strict, refused for downgrade without `--confirm-pitfalls`).
- `bash scripts/upgrade-project.sh --backfill-only` — migrate a pre-BL-030 project's manifest in place (defaults to strict).

Throughout the rest of this section, the tier breakdown describes the **shape of enforcement at each tier**. Your enforcement level controls **which of those tiers actually fire on user-terminal commits**:
- `strict` (default): every tier listed below applies to both Claude-issued commits AND your terminal commits.
- `light`: every tier applies to Claude. Your terminal commits skip Tier 2 hooks but are still captured by Tier 1 CI and recorded post-hoc by the audit detector.
- `no`: every tier applies to Claude. Your terminal commits are entirely unchecked by the framework.

**Tier 1 — Mechanically enforced (CI pipeline).** These checks run automatically on every push. They block merges when they fail. You cannot accidentally bypass them.

| Control | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| SAST scanning (Semgrep) | CI step — fails build on findings |
| Dependency vulnerability audit | CI step — language-specific tool |
| License compliance check | CI step — fails on copyleft |
| Tests must pass | CI step — fails build |
| Build must succeed | CI step |
| Phase gate consistency | CI step — **blocks build** when `.claude/phase-state.json` and `APPROVAL_LOG.md` are out of sync. Set `SOIF_PHASE_GATES=warn` to downgrade to warning. |

**Tier 1.5 — CI annotations (warning, not blocking).** These checks run in CI and surface warnings as GitHub Actions annotations. They do not block merges by default. Set the corresponding `SOIF_STRICT_*` variable to `true` to upgrade to a hard block.

| Control | Mechanism | Strict mode |
|---|---|---|
| Changelog freshness | CI step — warns when source files change without `CHANGELOG.md` update | `SOIF_STRICT_CHANGELOG=true` |
| Session state freshness | CI step — warns when `CLAUDE.md` hasn't been updated in 5+ commits or 24+ hours | `SOIF_STRICT_SESSION=true` |

**Tier 2 — Partially enforced (hooks and plugins).** These provide automated checks but can be bypassed (intentionally or through misconfiguration). They catch common mistakes; they are not compliance controls.

| Control | Mechanism | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Secret detection (gitleaks) | Pre-commit hook + CI pipeline scan — blocks commit and PR | Only catches patterns gitleaks knows. `--no-verify` skips the hook but the CI scan is a hard backstop. In `strict` enforcement mode, the SessionStart out-of-band detector also records any commit that landed via `--no-verify` to `.claude/bypass-audit.json`. |
| SAST quick scan (Semgrep) | Pre-commit hook — blocks commit on findings; CI runs full scan | Pre-commit scans only staged files with `p/owasp-top-ten`. `--no-verify` skips the hook; the CI scan is a hard backstop and (in `strict` mode) the audit detector records the bypass. |
| TDD ordering check (BL-072) | **`commit-msg`** git hook (covers both agent and human/editor commits) delegating to `pre-commit-gate.sh --terminal-mode --tdd-only`. **Tier-keyed on `deployment`+`poc_mode`:** WARN-only on Personal / Private-POC (and unscaffolded repos); **hard block** (rc=1) on Sponsored-POC / Production. Fires when a `feat`/`fix`/`refactor` commit ships implementation with no matching test. | Heuristic — checks test-file presence, not test quality; excludes `*.md`, lockfiles, and pure deletions. On a hard-block tier, `SOLO_TDD_ATTESTED=1` (recorded to `.claude/process-state.json::tdd_attestations[]`) is the attested escape — an escape that cannot be durably recorded refuses the commit. See the Builder's Guide, "TDD ordering enforcement (BL-072)." |
| Schema migration check | Pre-commit hook — warns when schema files are edited directly in Phase 2+ | Only active in Phase 2+; initial schema creation in Phase 0-1 is expected |
| TDD discipline (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) | Superpowers plugin (optional) | Strongly encourages, does not prevent non-TDD code from being committed |

**Tier 3 — Guided (LLM instructions and human discipline).** These are rules written in CLAUDE.md, the Builder's Guide, and the Project Bible. The AI agent follows them. You review the output at decision gates. There is no automated backstop if the agent ignores them or you skip the review.

| Control | Where It's Defined |
|---|---|
| Features must be in the MVP Cutline | Product Manifesto, CLAUDE.md |
| Context Health Checks every 3-4 features | Builder's Guide |
| Approval log entries authored by the approver | Governance Framework |

**What this means in practice:** The CI pipeline is your hard floor — it catches security, dependency, build issues, and phase gate violations mechanically. CI annotations warn you about documentation freshness without blocking your work. The pre-commit hooks are your early warning system — they catch secrets, nudge you on test co-location, and flag direct schema edits. In the **default `strict` enforcement level**, a second hard floor exists locally: `.git/hooks/framework-gate.sh` blocks user-terminal commits that violate the Build Loop / Phase classifier, and the SessionStart detector records any commit that landed via `--no-verify` to `.claude/bypass-audit.json`. You can route around the block; you cannot route around the audit. Everything else depends on you following the process and reviewing the agent's output at decision gates.

**Strict mode:** Organizations that want tighter enforcement can set environment variables in their CI workflow to upgrade warnings to hard blocks:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SOIF_PHASE_GATES=warn` | Downgrade phase gate check from block to warning |
| `SOIF_STRICT_CHANGELOG=true` | Changelog check blocks CI |
| `SOIF_STRICT_SESSION=true` | Session freshness check blocks CI |

### Process Enforcement (Tier 2)

The framework mechanically enforces sequential process compliance through a state machine and commit gating system. Five processes are gated:

1. **Phase 1 Architecture** — architecture selected → threat model complete → data model defined → UI scaffolding done → bible synthesized. Prevents skipping the threat model or other critical planning steps.
2. **Build Loop** (Phase 2) — tests → verify failing → implement → security audit → documentation → record feature. Each step must be completed in order. Source commits are blocked until all steps pass.
3. **UAT Session** (Phase 2) — 9-step testing flow from dispatching test agents through gate passage. Bug fix commits are blocked until the full session checklist is complete.
4. **Phase 3 Validation** — 9 steps: integration testing, security hardening, chaos testing, accessibility audit, performance audit, contract testing, results archived, pre-launch preparation, legal review. Artifact existence checks verify scan results are archived before steps can be marked complete.
5. **Phase 4 Release** — 6 steps: production build, rollback tested, go-live verified, monitoring configured, handoff written, handoff tested. Artifact checks require rollback test evidence, HANDOFF.md, monitoring documentation, and handoff test results.

The agent calls `scripts/process-checklist.sh --complete-step PROCESS:STEP` to advance through each process. A PreToolUse hook on `git commit` and `gh pr create` blocks when required steps are incomplete.

**What the Orchestrator sees:** When the agent attempts a commit with incomplete steps, Claude Code displays the block reason — for example: "Build Loop step 'security_audit' not completed. Run: scripts/process-checklist.sh --complete-step build_loop:security_audit". The agent must complete the missing step before the commit will be allowed.

**Tool usage tracking:** During Phase 2, the framework tracks whether the agent consulted Context7 (library documentation) and Qdrant (persistent memory). Warnings appear at commit time if Context7 hasn't been used in 2+ commits, and at session end if Qdrant was never used despite source commits being made. These are warnings, not blocks.

**Emergency escape:** If the enforcement system blocks a legitimate action due to a bug or edge case, the Orchestrator (not the agent) can run `scripts/process-checklist.sh --reset PROCESS` to clear the state for one process, or `--reset-all` to clear everything. Resets are logged.

**Check current state:** Run `scripts/process-checklist.sh --status` to see where each process stands — which steps are completed and which remain.

#### Process Enforcement Details

The following behaviors are by design but not obvious from the high-level description above. Understanding them prevents confusion when the enforcement system behaves in a way you do not expect.

**Phase 2 initialization and `--verify-init`:** When the agent completes Phase 2 initialization steps individually via `--complete-step phase2_init:STEP`, the system auto-sets `phase2_init.verified = true` once all 7 steps are marked complete. You do not need to run `--verify-init` separately in that case. The `--verify-init` command exists as an alternative path: it auto-detects completed steps by inspecting your environment (git remote, CI pipeline, scaffold, hooks) and marks them in bulk. Either path results in the same verified state. If you see a commit blocked with "Phase 2 initialization not verified," run `--verify-init` to let the script detect what is already in place.

**`--start-feature` and `--complete-step` are phase-agnostic.** The script does not prevent an agent at Phase 2 from running `--complete-step phase3_validation:integration_testing` or `--start-phase3`. Enforcement happens at commit time, not at step-completion time. When the agent calls `--check-commit-ready`, the script checks the current phase (from `.claude/phase-state.json`) and only enforces the steps relevant to that phase. Steps completed for a future phase are recorded but have no effect until the project transitions to that phase. This is by design — it allows preparatory work without blocking commits.

**Build loop step 6 (`feature_recorded`) is not required for commits.** The build loop has 6 steps: `tests_written`, `tests_verified_failing`, `implemented`, `security_audit`, `documentation_updated`, and `feature_recorded`. At commit time, only the first 5 are required. Step 6 (`feature_recorded`) is a post-commit bookkeeping step — it records the feature in the build progress tracker via `test-gate.sh --record-feature`. If you start a new feature without recording the previous one, the script warns you but does not block. This is because the commit itself is the source artifact; the recording is metadata for context health checks.

**Docs-only commits bypass build loop checks.** When all staged files have documentation extensions (`.md`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.tmpl`), the commit is allowed without completing any build loop steps. This is by design — documentation fixes, configuration updates, and template changes should not require a full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. The check also skips enforcement for files outside source directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `pkg/`, `internal/`, `cmd/`). If a commit mixes source and documentation files, the full build loop enforcement applies.

**Competency Matrix: self-assessment vs. enforcement timing.** The Competency Matrix you fill out in the Intake (Section 6) is a self-assessment that influences agent behavior from Phase 0 onward — honest "No" answers cause the agent to choose conservative, well-documented options. However, mechanical security enforcement (CI-level SAST, dependency audits, mandatory peer review triggers) only activates from Phase 2 when the CI pipeline and pre-commit hooks are installed. In Phases 0 and 1, the matrix is a planning input, not an enforcement mechanism. Organizations requiring security peer review for "No" or "Partially" on Security: that review is triggered at Phase 2 exit (see the organizational-only actions in the Phase 2 Completion Checkpoint).

**`pre-commit-gate.sh` is a Claude Code hook, not a git hook.** Despite its name, `pre-commit-gate.sh` is registered as a PreToolUse hook in the Claude Code configuration (`.claude/settings.json`). It intercepts `git commit` and `gh pr create` commands that the AI agent issues through the Bash tool. It reads JSON from stdin in the Claude Code hook format (`{"command": "git commit -m '...'"}`) and returns a JSON permission decision. It does not run as a traditional git pre-commit hook (those are separate — gitleaks and Semgrep use the git hook mechanism). If you are troubleshooting why the agent's commits are blocked, check `.claude/settings.json` for the PreToolUse hook registration, not `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

**PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md sections map to Phase 0 steps.** The manifesto template (`templates/generated/product-manifesto.tmpl`) contains HTML comments like `<!-- Source: Phase 0 Step 0.1 -->` that indicate which Phase 0 step produced each section. When reviewing the manifesto, these comments help you trace a section back to the prompt that generated it and the corresponding review checklist in the Builder's Guide.

### Time Commitment

From the Builder's Guide:

| Phase | Human Hours | Calendar Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0:** Product Discovery | 3-5 | 1-2 days |
| **Phase 1:** Architecture & Planning | 4-8 | 2-4 days |
| **Phase 2:** Construction | 15-40 | 2-6 weeks |
| **Phase 3:** Validation & Hardening | 5-12 | 3-7 days |
| **Phase 4:** Release & Maintenance | 3-8 | 1-3 days |
| **Total (experienced)** | **30-73 hours** | **4-10 weeks** |
| **Total (first project)** | **50-110 hours** | **8-14 weeks** |

Plan using the upper bounds. Desktop and mobile projects take more time than web projects in Phases 1, 3, and 4. First-time setup adds 9-19 hours of one-time overhead (tool installation, accounts, repository setup, security tooling, platform-specific toolchain).

Post-launch maintenance stabilizes to 1-2 hours/week (50-80 hours/year). The first 3 months are heavier: expect 2-4 hours/week as you learn the application's production behavior.

### 1.1 Personal Project Prerequisites

**Tools to install:**

| Tool | Required | How to Get It |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Yes | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| Language runtime | Yes | Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin, C#/.NET, or Dart/Flutter — depends on your language choice |
| jq | Yes | Init offers auto-install (brew/apt/dnf). Required by the Development Guardrails for Claude Code for JSON operations. |
| Git host CLI (`gh` or `glab`) | Yes, if using GitHub or GitLab (default host: GitHub) | **Install and authenticate before running init** — not auto-installed. `gh`: `brew install gh`, then `gh auth login`. `glab`: `brew install glab`, then `glab auth login`. Bitbucket needs no CLI (just `curl`) — export `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN` + `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN_EMAIL` + `BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE` instead. See [CLI Setup Addendum § Git Host CLIs](cli-setup-addendum.md#git-host-clis). |
| Docker | Recommended | Init offers auto-install. macOS: Colima (recommended, headless) or Docker Desktop. Linux: system package. Needed for Qdrant semantic memory and OWASP ZAP DAST scanning. |
| Claude Code | Recommended | Installed by `init.sh`, or manually: `brew install claude-code` (macOS) |

**Windows users:** WSL is required. The init script, Claude Code, and all CLI tooling expect a Unix shell. Install WSL first, then install your runtime inside it.

**Accounts to create:**

- **GitHub** (or GitLab/Bitbucket, matching your host choice) — free tier is fine
- **AI subscription** — Claude Max (consumer tier) works for personal projects

That is everything. No governance. No approvals. No paperwork. You can start building immediately after running `init.sh`.

---

### 1.2 Organizational Project Prerequisites

**Tools:** Same as personal (Section 1.1).

**Accounts:**

- **GitHub Team or Enterprise** — your organization's standard
- **AI subscription** — commercial or enterprise tier required (Claude Enterprise, API with commercial terms, or zero-data-retention agreement)

**The 6 blocking pre-conditions:**

Before you write a single line of code, 6 things must be resolved. None of them are technical. They are emails, meetings, and paperwork.

| # | Pre-Condition | What It Means | Who to Contact | What to Ask | What You Need Back | Record In |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **AI Deployment Path** | Your IT Security team decides how source code reaches the AI provider — commercial API, enterprise agreement, zero-data-retention, or self-hosted. | IT Security / CISO office | "We are evaluating AI-assisted development. What is our approved deployment path for sending source code to an AI provider?" | Written approval specifying the path (e.g., "Commercial API with ZDR agreement approved") | APPROVAL_LOG.md |
| 2 | **Insurance Confirmation** | Your insurance broker confirms that cyber liability, E&O, and D&O policies cover AI-generated code. | Insurance broker or Risk Management | "Do our current policies cover incidents caused by AI-generated code in production applications?" | Written broker confirmation letter | APPROVAL_LOG.md |
| 3 | **Liability Entity** | Legal decides which company entity (parent or subsidiary) bears liability for the application. | General Counsel / Legal | "Which entity should be designated as liable for this internally-developed application?" | Written designation | APPROVAL_LOG.md |
| 4 | **Project Sponsor** | A business owner who approves budget, answers escalations, and signs off at phase gates. | Your management chain | "I need a named business sponsor for this project. They approve budget and sign off at 3 decision gates." | Name and role | PROJECT_INTAKE.md Section 8 |
| 5 | **Backup Maintainer** | A second technologist who can keep the app running if you are unavailable. | Your management chain or peer engineers | "I need a designated backup who can take over maintenance using the handoff documentation." | Name and role | PROJECT_INTAKE.md Section 8 |
| 6 | **ITSM Registration** | The project is visible in your organization's IT portfolio tracker. | ITSM / PMO team | "I need to register a new internally-developed application in the portfolio tracker." | Ticket number or portfolio entry ID | APPROVAL_LOG.md |

**Phase 0 cannot start until all 6 are resolved.** Not "in progress." Resolved.

If insurance coverage is insufficient, your broker can advise on supplemental AI-specific riders or umbrella policies. If your organization does not have an AI deployment path, you need IT Security to create one — that process may take weeks and is outside your control.

See the [Governance Framework](governance-framework.md) for the full compliance screening matrix and approval authority structure.

#### Proof of Concept (POC) Modes

If you want to validate the framework before completing all governance approvals, the intake wizard (`scripts/intake-wizard.sh`) offers two POC modes:

| Mode | What's Required | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| **Sponsored POC** | AI deployment path, project sponsor, time allocation | Insurance, liability entity, ITSM, exit criteria, backup maintainer |
| **Private POC** | Nothing — personal exploration on your own time | All 6 pre-conditions |

**POC constraints:** No production deployment, no real user data, no external users. All technical work (code, tests, scans, documentation) is production-grade and carries forward unchanged.

**Both POC types follow the full phase-gate process** (Phases 0-3) identically to a production build — same TDD, same security scanning, same threat modeling. Phase 4 stops at "ready to deploy" but does not deploy to production.

**Upgrading to production:** When ready, run `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-production` to walk through the deferred pre-conditions and remove POC constraints. The legacy alias `scripts/intake-wizard.sh --upgrade-to-production` also works (it delegates to `upgrade-project.sh` internally), but `upgrade-project.sh --to-production` is the canonical command.

#### POC Mode Lifecycle

POC mode is enforced at two levels:

| Enforcement Point | Mechanism | What It Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase gate** (`check-phase-gate.sh`) | Checks `poc_mode` in `.claude/phase-state.json` at the Phase 3 to Phase 4 transition | Blocks the phase gate with an error directing you to `upgrade-project.sh --to-production` |
| **Process checklist** (`process-checklist.sh --start-phase4`) | Checks `poc_mode` before initializing the Phase 4 step sequence | Blocks the `--start-phase4` command entirely — returns an error before any Phase 4 steps are created |

Both enforcement points must be cleared before Phase 4 work can begin. Running `upgrade-project.sh --to-production` removes the `poc_mode` field from `.claude/phase-state.json`, which unblocks both checks.

**The `sponsored_poc` "no real user data" constraint is governance-only.** No tooling inspects your data sources or enforces this constraint mechanically. It is your responsibility to ensure that POC environments do not contain production user data. Violations are a governance issue, not a tooling failure.

**POC mode does not affect Phases 0-3.** The full TDD cycle, security scanning, threat modeling, and all process enforcement steps run identically in POC and production modes. The only difference is the Phase 4 gate block. This means all code produced during a POC carries forward without rework when you upgrade to production.

### 1.3 Contractor/Consultant and Employment Considerations

**If you are using this framework for client work or within an employment relationship:**

- **Employment agreements:** Verify that your employment agreement or contractor agreement permits AI-assisted development. Standard IP assignment clauses may not contemplate AI-generated code, and the copyright status of such code is legally unsettled. Confirm with your employer or client before transmitting any project data to an AI provider.
- **NDAs and confidentiality:** Transmitting client source code, business logic, or architectural decisions to an AI provider's API may violate confidentiality provisions in your consulting agreement, MSA, or NDA. Review these agreements for compatibility with AI tool usage before project initiation.
- **Client consent:** If working on client projects, the client should be informed that an AI coding tool will be used and that project data will be transmitted to a third-party AI provider. Obtain written consent where required by your agreement.
- **AI-generated code IP disclosure:** Organizations should update employment agreements and contractor agreements to address AI tool usage and the ownership of AI-assisted output.

These are not framework-specific issues — they apply to any AI-assisted development. The framework's AI Data Transmission Policy (Governance Framework, Section VII) provides deployment path options that address some of these concerns, but contractual obligations are between you and your employer or client.

## 2. Project Initialization (Running init.sh)

### What the Script Asks You

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator.git
cd solo-orchestrator
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh --project-dir my-project
```

Running init.sh from inside the clone is the supported flow. `--project-dir my-project` — a bare folder name — creates the project **beside** the clone, as a sibling of `solo-orchestrator/`, and skips the directory prompt below. Pass an absolute path instead and it is used exactly as given. Plain `./init.sh` with no flags still works and asks you interactively. Either way init refuses a target that would write onto the framework itself — the clone, anything inside it, or another copy of solo-orchestrator.

The script prompts for 7 inputs (6 if you passed `--project-dir`):

| Prompt | What You Enter | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **Project name** | Lowercase, no spaces (e.g., `invoice-tool`) | This becomes the directory name and appears in generated files. |
| **One-sentence description** | What does it do, in plain language | Used in CLAUDE.md and the Intake template. |
| **Platform type** | Web / Desktop / Mobile / MCP Server / Other | Determines which Platform Module is loaded and which release pipeline is generated. Pick the primary delivery surface. See the [Extending Platforms Guide](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator/blob/main/docs/extending-platforms.md) to add new platform types. |
| **Project track** | Light / Standard / Full | **Light:** internal tools, <10 users, skip market audit. **Standard:** external users, moderate complexity. **Full:** enterprise buyers, sensitive data, pen testing mandatory. |
| **Personal or Organizational** | Personal / Organizational | Organizational adds governance pre-flight requirements and approval authority structures. |
| **Primary language** | TypeScript, Python, Rust, C#, Kotlin, Java, Go, Dart, Swift, Other | Determines the CI pipeline template (testing, linting, SAST, dependency audit). |
| **Project directory** | Path — press Enter to accept the default | Where the project is created. The default is the **clone's parent directory** plus your project name, i.e. a sibling of `solo-orchestrator/` (it falls back to `~/projects/` only if that parent cannot be resolved). Typing a bare name here resolves against that same parent, so it also lands beside the clone; type an absolute path to put it anywhere else. Skipped entirely when you pass `--project-dir`. |

### What Gets Generated

| File / Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent instructions — the AI reads this automatically at session start |
| `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` | Your product definition template — you fill this out |
| `APPROVAL_LOG.md` | Phase gate approval record (organizational projects always; personal projects recommended) |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI pipeline — language-specific (test, lint, SAST, audit) |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Release pipeline — platform-specific (build, sign, distribute) |
| `.gitignore` | Language + platform appropriate ignores |
| `.claude/framework/` | Development Guardrails for Claude Code (Git hook guardrails) |
| `docs/reference/` | Builder's Guide, Governance Framework, Executive Review, CLI Setup Addendum |
| `docs/platform-modules/` | Platform-specific guidance for your selected platform |
| `docs/test-results/` | Empty — populated during Phase 3 |

Each project is self-contained. No runtime dependency on the solo-orchestrator repo after init.

The init script also generates **two pipelines**: a CI pipeline (`ci.yml`) selected by your language (handles testing, linting, SAST, dependency audit, license checking) and a release pipeline (`release.yml`) selected by your platform (handles building, signing, packaging, and distribution). CI pipelines are working GitHub Actions workflows that run immediately on first push. Release pipelines are production-ready templates that require configuration — code signing, deployment secrets, and store credentials must be set up before your first release.

**`--git-host other` (bring-your-own host and CI).** For the `other` git host (Gitea, Codeberg, self-hosted, or any SCM without a first-class driver), init.sh deliberately does **not** lay down `ci.yml` / `release.yml` — there is no canonical destination, so you configure your own CI/CD (a `.gitlab-ci.yml`, a Jenkinsfile, or your host's pipeline format). That is a one-time manual setup item, **not a failure**: `verify-install.sh` surfaces it as a non-blocking *"configure manually"* warning (it never counts toward the manual-action total that fails the check).

Because `other` is also the bring-your-own-*host* path, init.sh runs `git push` to the URL you paste — and a **failed** push is a **real failure**, handled by your project's **tier** (never silently masked). The tier is decided by your `deployment` + governance mode, **not** by the `track` field (so a Sponsored/Production project can never bypass a failed push by carrying `--track light`):

- **POC-Sponsored / MVP-Production (`deployment=organizational`, or `poc_mode=sponsored_poc`):** a working remote is **mandatory**. A failed push makes init print **"Setup INCOMPLETE"** and exit non-zero — no flag bypasses it (not even `--track light`).
- **Personal / POC-Personal (`deployment=personal`):** the push failure is still a real failure by default, but you may **explicitly acknowledge** it and proceed: `--accept-local-only-risk` keeps the project local (no remote) and accepts the **data-loss risk**; `--defer-remote-push` lets you push later (`git push -u origin main`). Both are recorded in `.claude/process-state.json`, and init exits 0. Interactively, init prompts and defaults to treating the failure as a failure.

Either way, the **Phase 1→2 gate enforces a verified remote**, keyed on the same tier: for POC-Sponsored / MVP-Production it is non-bypassable (a local-only acknowledgment does not let these advance), and a Personal / POC-Personal project that *deferred* its push cannot advance until the remote actually has the branch (only an acknowledged *local-only* project may advance without one). First-class hosts (`github`/`gitlab`/`bitbucket`) always keep the hard-fail contract: a real push or protection failure there makes init exit non-zero.

### What Is Auto-Generated vs. What You Configure

| File | Created By | You Must | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | init.sh (starter version) | Update at each phase transition and end of each session | The starter version works until you configure optional enhancements. When you add Superpowers, Context7, or Qdrant, replace with the [enhanced template](cli-setup-addendum.md#6-claudemd). |
| `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` | init.sh (blank template) | Fill out completely before Phase 0 | The primary input to the entire process |
| `APPROVAL_LOG.md` | init.sh (empty with headers) | Add entries at each phase gate | Append-only — never edit previous entries |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | init.sh (language-specific) | Nothing — works on first push | Modify only if adding a secondary language |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | init.sh (platform-specific) | Configure secrets and signing before first release | Contains `TODO` markers for per-project configuration |
| `.gitignore` | init.sh | Nothing | Add entries as needed |
| `.claude/framework/` | init.sh (cloned from GitHub) | Nothing | Git hooks are auto-installed |
| `.claude/phase-state.json` | init.sh | Nothing — updated by scripts | Tracks current phase |
| `.claude/manifest.json` | init.sh + CDF | Nothing — updated by scripts | Tracks framework version, git host, project mode, remote URL |
| `docs/reference/` | init.sh (copied from solo-orchestrator) | Nothing | Reference documents |
| `docs/platform-modules/` | init.sh (copied) | Nothing | Platform-specific guidance |
| `docs/reference/security-scan-guide.md` | init.sh (copied) | Nothing | Plain-language guide for common scan findings |
| `scripts/intake-wizard.sh` | init.sh (copied) | Run to fill out the Intake | Guided script or AI-assisted conversation |
| `scripts/resume.sh` | init.sh (copied) | Run at session start | Prints the exact first message to paste — state-aware: intake prompt, Phase-0 initialization prompt (Intake §13), or the classic resume prompt |
| `templates/intake-suggestions/` | init.sh (copied) | Nothing | Context-aware suggestions for the wizard |
| **Superpowers** | You (optional) | Install plugin, configure in CLAUDE.md | See [CLI Setup Addendum](cli-setup-addendum.md#1-superpowers) |
| **Context7 MCP** | You (optional) | One command to add MCP server | See [CLI Setup Addendum](cli-setup-addendum.md#4-context7) |
| **Qdrant MCP** | You (optional) | Docker + MCP server config | See [CLI Setup Addendum](cli-setup-addendum.md#5-qdrant) |

### `.claude/manifest.json` — Project State Schema

The manifest is a JSON file maintained jointly by CDF (for framework version pin) and solo-orchestrator (for host/mode/remote). Notable fields:

- `frameworkVersion` — CDF (Development Guardrails) version pin. Written at init and re-bumped by `scripts/upgrade-project.sh` when it refreshes CDF assets (see [Refreshing CDF framework assets](#refreshing-cdf-framework-assets) below).
- `frameworkCommit` — the CDF clone commit the pinned assets were synced from. Re-bumped alongside `frameworkVersion`.
- `host` — git host type: `github` | `gitlab` | `bitbucket` | `other`. Written at init time; consumed by host-aware scripts to route calls through the correct driver.
- `mode` — project mode: `personal` | `org`. Controls protection bar and some governance paths.
- `remote_url` — HTTPS clone URL of the remote created at init.

Scripts should always read these via `jq` (e.g., `jq -r '.host' .claude/manifest.json`) rather than parsing manually.

### What to Check After Init

The script runs a health check. Review its output:

- **Green checks** mean tools are installed and working
- **Yellow warnings** mean optional tools are missing (GPG) — install when needed. Docker is offered during init (Colima recommended on macOS) and Qdrant is offered at Phase 1.
- **Red failures** mean required tools are missing — fix before proceeding

The health check also validates your language runtime. If it reports a version mismatch or missing runtime, install the correct version before proceeding.

### Post-Init Authentication

```bash
cd ~/projects/your-project   # or wherever you created it
claude                        # Follow the OAuth prompt in your browser
snyk auth                     # Authenticate Snyk CLI
```

Both are one-time per machine.

### Optional Enhancements

After init, you can configure additional tooling. These are not required for your first project, but each addresses a specific pain point. **Configure them when you feel the pain, not during initial setup** — except Context7, which is useful from Phase 1.

| Tool | What It Does | When to Configure | Setup Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Context7 MCP** | Gives the AI up-to-date library documentation instead of relying on training data | **Before Phase 1** — helps the AI make accurate architecture and implementation decisions | One command, no prerequisites |
| **Superpowers** | Agentic skills plugin — strict TDD, subagent-driven development, systematic debugging, git worktrees | **Before Phase 2** — accelerates the Build Loop significantly | One command, no prerequisites |
| **Qdrant MCP** | Persistent semantic memory across sessions — the AI remembers project decisions and patterns | **Phase 1** — offered automatically when Docker is available. Each project gets an isolated collection. | Requires Docker (Colima or Docker Desktop) |
| **Development Guardrails for Claude Code** | Git hook-based guardrails for coding standards, security scanning, documentation | Auto-installed by init.sh | Already done |

See the [CLI Setup Addendum](cli-setup-addendum.md) for detailed instructions, or use the [Quick Setup](cli-setup-addendum.md#quick-setup--all-recommended-enhancements) to configure all three at once.

## 3. Filling Out the Project Intake

Open `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`. This is the most important thing you do before starting.

**Why it matters:** Every blank field is a round-trip with the agent. A complete Intake means the agent works autonomously. An incomplete Intake means the agent stops and asks you — repeatedly.

### Using the Intake Wizard

The fastest way to fill out the Intake is the guided wizard:

```bash
cd your-project
bash scripts/intake-wizard.sh
```

The wizard offers three modes:

| Mode | Best For | Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Guided Script** | You know your requirements and technical preferences | 30-60 min |
| **AI-Assisted** | You want help thinking through requirements or are unsure about choices | 45-90 min |
| **Manual** | You prefer to fill out PROJECT_INTAKE.md directly in your editor | Varies |

The guided script saves progress after each section — you can pause with `pause` at any prompt and resume later with `scripts/intake-wizard.sh --resume`. Type `?` at any prompt to see context-aware suggestions for your platform and language.

The AI-assisted mode generates a prompt for Claude Code that walks you through the intake conversationally, explaining each field and suggesting options based on your project type.

### Section-by-Section Guidance

**Section 1: Project Identity** — Fill in every field. This is straightforward: project name, track, platform, deployment type. If you answered these during `init.sh`, confirm they match.

**Section 2: Business Context** — The problem statement and user personas drive everything downstream. "Improve efficiency" is not a problem statement. "The finance team spends 6 hours/week manually reconciling invoices from 3 systems into a single spreadsheet" is.

Write 3-5 success criteria with measurable targets and measurement methods. Write 3-5 explicit out-of-scope items — these prevent the agent from building features you did not ask for.

**Section 3: Constraints** — Be honest about your available hours per week. "As time allows" means unpredictable, and the agent cannot plan around it. Set a realistic monthly infrastructure budget ceiling. Name who approves spending (or "self" for personal projects).

**Section 4: Features & Requirements** — This is the most important section.

For each must-have feature, define:
- **Business Logic Trigger:** "If [condition], the system must [action] and output [result]"
- **Failure State:** What happens when input is invalid, a service is unavailable, or the user abandons

If you cannot articulate the trigger and failure state, the feature is not defined well enough to build.

Example of a well-defined feature:

| # | Feature | Business Logic Trigger | Failure State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Invoice reconciliation | If user uploads CSV files from systems A, B, and C, the system must match invoices by invoice number and flag mismatches exceeding $0.01 | If CSV format is invalid, reject with specific error ("Column 'Invoice Number' not found"). If file exceeds 50MB, reject with size limit message. If matching fails mid-process, preserve partial results and show which rows failed. |

Limit to 8 must-have features. More than 8 means your MVP is too large.

**Section 5: Data & Integrations** — Assign a sensitivity classification to every data input: Public, Internal, Confidential, PII, Financial, Health/Medical, or Regulated. This determines encryption requirements, access controls, and logging levels — it is not optional metadata.

For third-party integrations, define what happens when the service is unavailable. The agent will build fallback behavior from this. "The app crashes" is not acceptable. "Show cached data with a stale-data banner and retry in 30 seconds" is.

Define data persistence explicitly: what must survive across sessions, what can be ephemeral, expected volume at 12 months, retention requirements, and backup expectations. Unanswered persistence questions create architectural debt in Phase 1.

**Section 6: Technical Preferences** — Two parts matter here.

*Architecture Preferences:* For each choice (language, database, framework, hosting), mark whether it is a **hard constraint** or a **preference**. Hard constraints are absolute — the agent will not recommend against them. Preferences can be challenged with justification.

*Competency Matrix:* For each domain (frontend, backend, security, accessibility, database, DevOps, performance, mobile), answer honestly: "Can I look at the AI's output and reliably determine if it's correct?"

| Your Self-Assessment | What Happens |
|---|---|
| "Yes" | You are the quality gate for that domain. No additional automated tooling is mandated. |
| "Partially" | The framework mandates automated tooling in Phase 3 to cover gaps in your review ability. |
| "No" | Same as "Partially," plus the agent defaults to the most conservative, well-documented option in that domain. |

If you mark "Yes" on Security but cannot actually evaluate authorization logic, the framework has no safety net for that domain. Every honest "No" adds automated coverage. Every dishonest "Yes" creates an unscanned attack surface. Lying here hurts you.

**Section 7: Revenue Model** — Fill in for Standard and Full track projects with external users. This drives architecture decisions: per-user cost estimates constrain hosting choices, break-even user counts constrain scalability requirements, and hosting cost ceilings at 1K/10K users force the agent to propose architectures that stay within budget as you grow.

Skip for Light track or internal tools.

**Section 8: Governance Pre-Flight**
- **Personal projects:** Skip this entire section.
- **Organizational projects:** Must be complete before Phase 0. This is where you record the 6 blocking pre-conditions from Section 1.2 of this guide, name your phase gate approvers (who signs off at each gate), define the 3-level escalation chain, and complete the compliance screening matrix with your project sponsor.

The compliance screening matrix includes 8 questions about regulatory exposure (SOX, PCI, privacy laws, EU AI Act, OFAC, records retention, pen testing). Complete it with your sponsor. Each "Yes" triggers a specific action that must be completed before going live.

**Section 9: Accessibility & UX** — WCAG AA is the minimum for any user-facing application. Specify browser support, device support, and whether dark mode is required. If you have users with color vision deficiency, note that explicitly — the agent will ensure the UI never relies on color alone for meaning.

These become architectural constraints from day 1. Retrofitting accessibility in Phase 3 is expensive. Designing for it in Phase 1 is nearly free.

**Section 10: Distribution & Operations** — Platform-specific. Fill in what applies to your platform:

- **Web:** Domain name, SSL certificate source, maintenance window restrictions
- **Desktop:** Distribution channels (GitHub Releases, Homebrew, winget, app stores), code signing (required now / deferred / not needed), installer format, auto-update mechanism, minimum OS versions
- **Mobile:** App Store / Google Play / enterprise sideload, developer accounts (Apple $99/yr, Google $25 one-time), beta testing channels

Define your uptime expectation. "Best effort" is fine for internal tools. 99.9% is reasonable for external products. If you need 99.99%+, this is not a Solo Orchestrator project.

**Section 11: Known Risks** — Anything the agent should know that does not fit elsewhere: technical debt you are aware of going in, political sensitivities (e.g., "this replaces a tool built by a different team"), dependencies on other projects or timelines, previous failed attempts at solving this problem and what you learned from them.

### The Checklist Before Starting

The Intake has a checklist at the bottom. Verify every item before starting:

- Every field is filled or explicitly marked N/A
- All must-have features have business logic triggers and failure states
- Will-Not-Have list has at least 3 items
- Data sensitivity classifications are assigned
- Competency Matrix is honest
- Budget and timeline are realistic
- (Organizational) All Section 8 blocking items are Complete
- The document is saved as `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` in the project repository

---

## 4. Working With the AI Agent

### Starting a Session

```bash
cd ~/projects/your-project
bash scripts/resume.sh   # prints the exact first message for where you are
claude                   # paste it as your first message
```

Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` — your project configuration, framework rules, and tool constraints — when the session starts, but the agent does not **act on** any of it until you send your **first message**. Until then nothing happens: a blank Claude Code screen means it is ready and waiting, not stuck.

`scripts/resume.sh` is the one place that decides what that first message should be. It is state-aware: the intake prompt while your Intake is unfinished, the Section 13 initialization prompt once the Intake is done and Phase 0 has not started, and a resume prompt once work is under way.

### The Initialization Prompt

Section 13 of the Intake contains a ready-to-use initialization prompt. `bash scripts/resume.sh` prints it verbatim at the point you need it, so you do not have to find and copy it by hand — but you can also paste it in yourself at the start of Phase 0. Either way, it tells the agent:

- The Intake is the primary constraint
- The Builder's Guide is the process reference
- The Platform Module is the platform-specific reference
- Hard constraints are absolute; preferences can be challenged with justification
- Blank fields must be flagged immediately

You also provide the Builder's Guide (`docs/reference/builders-guide.md`) and the relevant Platform Module.

### The Agent's Operating Model

The agent works autonomously between decision gates. It reads your Intake, follows the Builder's Guide, and builds. It stops when:

1. **It needs information** — a blank or ambiguous field in the Intake
2. **It reaches a decision gate** — an artifact that requires your review and approval
3. **It finds a conflict** — a contradiction between your constraints and technical feasibility

**When the agent asks you a question:** Answer it. The agent stopped for a reason. Vague answers ("whatever you think is best") produce vague output that you will reject later. Be specific: "Use PostgreSQL" not "whatever database you think is best."

**When the agent presents a decision gate:** Review the artifact carefully. Approve it, or explain specifically what needs to change — "the user journey for the export feature doesn't account for empty data sets" is actionable. "This doesn't feel right" is not. Record every approval in `APPROVAL_LOG.md`.

**When the agent proposes something outside the Intake:** Push back. The Intake is the governing constraint. If the agent suggests a feature not in the MVP Cutline, a technology you excluded, or an architecture that contradicts your hard constraints, tell it to stop and reference the specific Intake section. The agent should not override your decisions without your explicit consent.

### Session-Start Version Check

Every session begins with a tooling health check. The agent runs `scripts/check-versions.sh`, which reads the tool matrix and checks every installed tool against its minimum version and the latest available version. This catches drift that accumulates between sessions — especially if weeks or months pass between work.

The version checker handles different tool types automatically via data-driven `update_check` strategies in the tool matrix:

| Strategy | Tools | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Standard version comparison | Git, Node, Semgrep, gitleaks, Snyk, Claude Code, jq, Colima | Compares installed version to minimum and latest available |
| `git_repo` | Development Guardrails for Claude Code | Fetches the remote and reports how many commits you are behind |
| `ephemeral` | Context7 MCP, Qdrant MCP | Reports "auto-updates" — these tools run via `npx`/`uvx` which always fetches the latest |
| `claude_plugin` | Superpowers | Reports "managed by Claude Code" — Claude handles plugin updates internally |
| `docker_image` | (Future: Qdrant container) | Compares running container image digest to the latest available |

If tools are out of date, the script offers interactive update options:
- **Update all** — runs update commands for every outdated tool
- **Select which to update** — choose specific tools by number
- **Skip** — prints the manual update commands for later

**Critical rule:** The agent will not proceed with Phase 2+ work if any required security tool (Semgrep, gitleaks, Snyk) is below its minimum version. This prevents building against outdated security scanning.

#### Extending the Version Check

The version check is data-driven through the tool matrix (`templates/tool-matrix/common.json` and platform-specific files). If you swap a tool (e.g., replace Qdrant with Supabase), update the tool matrix entry — `check-versions.sh` reads the `update_check` method and handles it automatically. No script changes required.

To add a new `update_check` type, add a handler case in the `check_for_update()` function in `scripts/check-versions.sh`.

### Session Management

AI coding agents have context limits. For long-running projects:

- **Start each session** by pointing the agent to `CLAUDE.md` (read automatically), then provide the `PROJECT_BIBLE.md` and relevant source files for context. The agent runs `scripts/check-versions.sh` automatically and reports any outdated tools before proceeding.
- **End each session** by confirming what was completed and what remains. The agent should update the Bible and CHANGELOG.md before you close.
- **Between sessions**, the agent does not retain state unless you have configured Qdrant MCP for persistent semantic memory. Without it, every session starts fresh with the Bible as context.
- **If a session goes poorly** (low-quality output, hallucinations, context drift), end it and start fresh. Do not try to steer a confused agent back on track — it is faster to restart.

---

## 5. Phase-by-Phase Walkthrough

This section covers what **you** do at each phase — not what the agent does. For the agent's process, prompts, and remediation procedures, see the [Builder's Guide](builders-guide.md). For platform-specific instructions at each phase, see your [Platform Module](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator/tree/main/docs/platform-modules).

**How to read this section:** Each phase has a table showing your actions with separate columns for personal and organizational paths. "Same" means no difference between paths. Where the organizational path has additional requirements, they are listed explicitly.

---

### Phase 0: Product Discovery (1-2 days, 3-5 human hours)

**What happens:** The agent reads your Intake and generates a Product Manifesto — a structured expansion of your product definition including functional requirements, user journeys, data contracts, and an MVP Cutline.

| Your Action | Personal | Organizational |
|---|---|---|
| Provide Intake + Builder's Guide + Platform Module to agent | Same | Same |
| Review Functional Requirements Document | Self-review | Self-review |
| Review user personas and interaction flows | Self-review | Self-review |
| Review data contracts (inputs, outputs, validation) | Self-review | Self-review |
| **DECISION GATE: Approve Product Manifesto** | Self-review; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md | Send to Project Sponsor for approval; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md with evidence reference |
| Trademark search (Standard+ track) | Search USPTO, app stores, domain registrars, WIPO | Same, plus document findings for legal |

**Revenue model review (Standard+ track):** The agent generates financial projections from your Section 7 data. Verify that break-even assumptions are realistic and that hosting costs remain tenable at 1,000 and 10,000 users.

**What you produce:** Approved `PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md`

**Key review questions:**
- Does the MVP Cutline match what you actually want to ship first?
- Are the user journeys realistic — would your actual users follow these paths?
- Are there features in the Manifesto you did not ask for? (Remove them.)
- Do the data contracts match your Section 5 inputs?
- Are the out-of-scope items explicitly listed? (They prevent scope creep in Phase 2.)

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 0 — Agent Prompts (click to expand)</strong></summary>

Use these prompts with your AI agent. Choose "With Intake" versions if you filled out the Project Intake first (recommended), or "Without Intake" versions for conversational discovery.

**Step 0.1: Functional Feature Set**

*With Intake (recommended):*

```
I am the Solo Orchestrator for [PROJECT NAME]. The attached Project
Intake contains my requirements and constraints.

Using the Intake as the primary source, generate a Functional
Requirements Document.

For each Must-Have feature:
1. Expand the business logic trigger into a complete specification.
2. Expand the failure state into a complete error/recovery flow.
3. Identify contradictions between features.
4. Identify implicit dependencies I haven't listed.

For the Will-Not-Have list: flag if any Must-Have implicitly requires
something on the exclusion list.

Do not add features beyond the Intake. Flag recommendations separately.
```

*Without Intake:*

```
I am the Solo Orchestrator for [PROJECT NAME]. Before we discuss code
or technology, we need to define the Feature Set.

Act as a Lead Product Manager with 15 years of experience. Based on
my goal of [INSERT GOAL], generate a Functional Requirements Document.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Budget: [$ per month for hosting/services, or one-time budget]
- Timeline: [X weeks to MVP]
- Target users at launch: [number]
- Target users at 12 months: [number]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. List the Must-Have features for MVP. For each: "If [condition],
   the system must [action] and output [result]."
2. List the Should-Have features for v1.1.
3. List the Will-Not-Have features (explicit scope boundaries).
4. For every Must-Have, define the failure state.
```

**Step 0.2: User Personas & Interaction Flow**

*With Intake:*

```
Using the Intake persona (Section 2.2) and Must-Have features (Section 4.1),
generate a complete User Journey Map.

Map the Success Path through ALL Must-Have features as a coherent experience.
For each step: what user sees, does, system responds, feedback mechanism.
Define failure recovery using the failure states from the Intake.
Flag any point where the journey reveals a feature gap.
```

*Without Intake:*

```
Map the User Journey for the primary persona.

1. Persona: Who, skill level, goal, emotional state on arrival.
2. Entry Point: How they first encounter the application.
3. Success Path: 3-5 steps. For each: what user sees, does, system responds.
4. Failure Recovery: At each step, what happens on bad input, lost
   connectivity, or abandonment.
5. Feedback Loops: How the app communicates success/failure/progress.
6. Exit Points: Where the user might abandon. Recovery strategies.
```

**Step 0.3: Data Input/Output & State Logic**

*With Intake:*

```
Using the Intake data definitions (Section 5), generate a formal Data Contract.

Verify validation rules are complete. Confirm sensitivity classifications.
Identify inputs implied by features but not listed. Define data flow from
input to storage to output. Flag integrations where "unavailable" breaks
a Must-Have. Review persistence model against budget constraints.
```

*Without Intake:*

```
Define the Data Contract.

1. INPUTS: Data type, validation rules, sensitivity classification per input.
2. TRANSFORMATIONS: Each processing step as a discrete operation.
3. OUTPUTS: Format, latency expectation per output.
4. THIRD-PARTY DATA: APIs/sources, fallback if unavailable, caching.
5. STATE: What persists across sessions vs. ephemeral. Define the boundary
   between "stored permanently" and "stored in memory/local session."
```

**Step 0.4: Product Manifesto & MVP Cutline**

*With Intake:*

```
Synthesize into a Product Manifesto. Use the Intake problem statement
(Section 2.1) as the foundation. MVP Cutline reflects Intake Section 4.1,
adjusted for any changes from Steps 0.1-0.3. If recommending a feature
move (Must-Have → Should-Have or vice versa), state the recommendation
and reason — do not change the cutline without my approval.

Include Open Questions: anything flagged during Steps 0.1-0.3 that
requires my decision before Phase 1.
```

*Without Intake:*

```
Combine the FRD, User Journeys, and Data Contracts into a Product Manifesto.

1. Product Intent: One paragraph — what and why.
2. MVP Cutline: Hard line. Only first-release features. Everything else
   goes to Post-MVP Backlog.
3. Manifesto Rules:
   - Architecture that contradicts the Manifesto is rejected.
   - Features not in the MVP Cutline are not built in Phase 2.
   - Post-MVP prioritized by user feedback, not this document.

Confirm: "I will use this Manifesto as my primary constraint."
```

### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning (2-4 days, 4-8 human hours)

**What happens:** The agent proposes 3 architecture options, generates a STRIDE threat model, designs the data model, and synthesizes everything into a Project Bible.

| Your Action | Personal | Organizational |
|---|---|---|
| Market signal validation (Standard+ track) | Get at least 1 positive signal before architecture investment | Same — document the signal |
| **DECISION GATE: Select architecture** from 3 options | Select one; document rationale for rejection of others | Same |
| Review STRIDE threat model | Verify mitigations are concrete, not "be careful" | Same |
| Review data model | Verify it supports all must-have features | Same |
| Review UI component specifications | Verify component states (empty, loading, error, success) | Same |
| **DECISION GATE: Approve Project Bible** | Self-review; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md | Senior Technical Authority reviews and approves; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md with evidence |

**What you produce:** Approved `PROJECT_BIBLE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, Architecture Decision Records

**Architecture selection — what to look for:**

The agent presents 3 options. For each, verify it includes: languages and frameworks (exact versions), data storage strategy, authentication approach, observability (logging, error reporting), secrets management, build/packaging strategy for all target platforms, and a scalability vs. velocity trade-off analysis. Reject any option that does not address your platform-specific requirements from the Platform Module.

Select one. Document why you rejected the other two. This is recorded as an Architecture Decision Record.

**Threat model — what to look for:**

The agent generates a STRIDE threat model. It should identify assets (user data, auth tokens, API keys, admin access), threat actors (unauthenticated users, authenticated malicious users, compromised dependencies, insiders), and attack vectors with concrete mitigations. "Be careful with user input" is not a mitigation. "Validate all user input at API boundary using schema validation; reject non-conforming requests with 400 status" is.

The architecture stress test should include: 5 edge cases where the stack would fail, 3 stack-specific security vulnerabilities, 2 data storage bottleneck risks, and 1 limitation that could force a rewrite in 12 months.

**Data migration (if replacing an existing system):** If legacy data exists, the agent produces a migration plan with source inventory, field mapping, transformation rules, a repeatable import script, rollback procedure, and validation criteria. You must be able to confirm migrated data is correct and complete.

**This is the point of no return.** If the architecture is wrong, fix it now. Discovering it mid-Phase 2 is far more expensive.

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 1 — Architecture Selection Prompt (click to expand)</strong></summary>

```
Based on the attached Product Manifesto, propose 3 architecture options.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Stack familiarity: [from Intake Section 6.1 or state here]
- Budget ceiling: [from Revenue Model or Intake Section 3.2]
- Solo maintainer — prioritize managed services, minimal infrastructure.
- Target MVP timeline: [X weeks].
- Target platforms: [from Intake — e.g., "Windows, macOS, Linux" or
  "Web" or "iOS and Android"]

For EACH option, include ALL of the following as first-class decisions:
1. Languages & Frameworks (exact versions)
2. Data storage strategy (justified by the data contracts)
3. Application architecture pattern
4. Authentication & Identity strategy (if applicable)
5. Observability: structured logging, error reporting. Day 1 decisions.
6. Secrets management
7. Build & packaging strategy for all target platforms
8. Scalability vs. Velocity trade-off
9. Distribution strategy (how users get the application)
10. Auto-update mechanism (if applicable)

[APPEND PLATFORM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FROM YOUR PLATFORM MODULE]

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 1 — Remediation Table (click to expand)</strong></summary>

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Over-Engineering** | AI suggests complex infrastructure for an MVP | "Solo maintainer with a $[X] ceiling. Simplify." |
| **Platform Mismatch** | Architecture doesn't match target platform constraints | "This must run as [platform requirement]. Redesign for that constraint." |
| **Security Gaps** | AI omits auth, data isolation, or encryption | "Missing [control]. Rewrite. Non-negotiable." |
| **Shallow Threat Model** | STRIDE analysis is generic | "These threats must be specific to our architecture. How does [vector] apply to [our stack]?" |
| **Missing Observability** | No logging, error tracking, or monitoring | "Observability is Day 1. Define logging, correlation IDs, error reporting now." |
| **Missing Build Strategy** | No plan for packaging/distributing on all target platforms | "How does this get to the user on [platform]? Define the build and distribution pipeline." |
| **Maintenance Overload** | Architecture requires DevOps the Orchestrator can't maintain | "Simplify. I cannot maintain this." |

</details>

---

### Phase 2: Construction (2-6 weeks, 15-40 human hours)

**What happens:** The agent builds features one at a time using TDD, starting with the highest-risk feature.

#### Project Initialization (Before the Build Loop)

Before any features are built, the agent initializes the project scaffolding. Verify these 8 checks pass before entering the Build Loop:

- [ ] Linter runs clean
- [ ] Test runner executes (0 tests, 0 failures)
- [ ] Initial data model applies successfully
- [ ] Pre-commit hook catches a test secret (verify gitleaks is working)
- [ ] Pre-commit hook catches a test vulnerability pattern (verify Semgrep is working)
- [ ] License checker runs clean
- [ ] CI pipeline passes on first push
- [ ] Backup and restore verified (test this now, not in Phase 4)
- [ ] Application builds and runs on at least one target platform

#### The Build Loop (Per Feature)

For each feature in the MVP Cutline, ordered by risk (highest-risk first):

| Step | What You Do |
|---|---|
| **1. Tests first (RED)** | Review the agent's test suite. Verify it includes: success-state tests, negative tests (invalid/empty/malicious input), and boundary tests. Then **write at least 3 test assertions yourself** — business logic tests, not "response is not null." Confirm all tests fail before implementation exists. |
| **2. Implementation (GREEN)** | The agent implements code to pass the tests. Run the full test suite — all tests must pass. Manually verify the feature works as expected. If something is wrong, direct specific fixes. |
| **3. Security audit** | Run `semgrep scan --config=p/owasp-top-ten --config=p/security-audit --config=r/javascript.browser.security.insecure-document-method --config=.semgrep/soif-dom-sinks.yml --max-target-bytes=0 src/` — the same rule set the pre-commit gate enforces, plus the audit pack. (A narrower audit command passes and the commit is then blocked by rules the audit never ran; see the Builder's Guide Step 2.4 note.) Review findings against the Phase 1 threat model. Check specifically for: data isolation (can one user access another's data?), input validation at all entry points, hardcoded secrets, N+1 queries, and structured logging of significant operations. |
| **4. AI-specific scrutiny** | The agent's code has known blind spots. For each feature, check: auth/access control (write explicit negative tests for unauthorized access), state management (if concurrent operations exist, write concurrency tests), data access efficiency (run EXPLAIN on AI-generated database queries touching user data), and input validation (test every user-facing input with injection payloads). |
| **5. Documentation update** | Verify the agent updates CHANGELOG.md (feature name, date, new interfaces), interface documentation (API endpoints, contracts, error codes), and the Project Bible (new interfaces, data changes, configuration, dependencies). |
| **6. Data model changes** | If the feature requires data model changes: generate a versioned change with "apply" and "rollback" operations, verify existing tests still pass, verify rollback cleanly reverts (against realistic data, not empty state), update data model documentation in the Bible. Never modify the data model directly — all changes through the versioning tool. |

**Good test assertions you write:**

```
"When user provides invalid email, system returns 400 with 'email format invalid' message"
"When user lacks permission, system returns 403 Forbidden, not 500"
"When 2 users edit the same record, last write wins with version number incremented"
"When CSV has 100,001 rows (over limit), system rejects with 'Maximum 100,000 rows' message"
"When third-party API returns 503, system shows cached data with stale-data warning"
```

Bad test assertions (too vague to catch real bugs):

```
"Response is not null"
"Status code is 200"
"It works"
```

**Interpreting scan results:** If you are unsure whether a finding is real or a false positive, see the [Security Scan Interpretation Guide](security-scan-guide.md) for plain-language explanations of the most common findings.

#### Context Health Checks (Every 3-4 Features)

Ask the agent to summarize: features built, features remaining, current data model, known issues. Compare this against the Project Bible.

If the summary contains hallucinations (references to features that do not exist, incorrect data model descriptions, contradictions with the Bible):

1. Start a fresh Claude Code session
2. Provide the updated `PROJECT_BIBLE.md` and the last 3-4 active source files
3. Tell the agent: "We are continuing Phase 2. Here is current state."

Do not try to correct a drifted agent in the same session. It is faster to restart.

#### When to Escalate

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Budget overrun (more hours than planned) | Re-evaluate remaining features. Defer should-have features. Notify sponsor (organizational). |
| Scope change request | Return to the Manifesto. If the change contradicts the MVP Cutline, it waits for v1.1. |
| Security finding that requires architecture change | Return to Phase 1. Revise the Bible. Get re-approval (organizational: Senior Technical Authority). |
| Agent producing consistently low-quality output | End the session. Start fresh. If quality does not improve, the Intake or Bible may be insufficiently detailed. |

#### Phase 2 Completion Checkpoint

All of these must be true before proceeding:

- [ ] All MVP Cutline features built and passing tests
- [ ] No partially implemented features
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] CI pipeline green
- [ ] Project Bible accurately reflects current codebase
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md current
- [ ] No unresolved security findings
- [ ] Application builds on all target platforms

If any check fails, return to the Build Loop. Do not proceed to Phase 3.

| Organizational-only actions during Phase 2 |
|---|
| Maintain an In-Phase Decision Log (date, decision, rationale, alternatives considered) for every non-trivial choice |
| Senior Technical Authority reviews this log at the Phase 2 exit |
| If your Competency Matrix shows "No" or "Partially" on Security: schedule a 1-2 hour security peer review with IT Security covering authorization logic, data isolation, business logic abuse, and auth edge cases |

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 2 — Remediation Table (click to expand)</strong></summary>

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Context Window Bleed** | AI hallucinates variables, forgets structure | Fresh session with Bible + last 3-4 active files |
| **Dependency Creep** | New package for every small problem | "Achieve this with the existing stack. Justify any new dependency." |
| **Logic Circularity** | AI rewrites the same bug in circles | "Stop coding. Explain the logic step-by-step. Find the flaw before fixing syntax." |
| **Silent Failures** | Code runs but errors are swallowed | "Every failure must produce a structured log entry and user-visible feedback." |
| **Regression** | Feature B breaks Feature A | "Run full suite. Identify conflict. Fix preserving both. Do not delete tests." |
| **Data Model Modified Directly** | Schema changed outside migration tool | "Revert. Generate a versioned migration. Apply through the tool." |
| **Architecture Wrong Mid-Build** | Construction reveals architecture can't support a requirement | Stop Phase 2. Return to Phase 1.2. Revise Bible. Expensive but cheaper than finishing wrong. |
| **Platform Inconsistency** | Works on one OS but not another | "Run tests on all target platforms. Fix platform-specific issues before continuing." |

</details>

---

### Phase 3: Validation & Security (3-7 days, 5-12 human hours)

**What happens:** Full security audit, integration tests, accessibility checks, performance tests. The assumption entering Phase 3 is that everything is broken until proven otherwise. Phase 2 built the features; Phase 3 proves they work correctly, securely, and accessibly.

| Your Action | Personal | Organizational |
|---|---|---|
| Run E2E/integration tests on all target platforms | Fix failures — these are integration gaps | Same |
| Run full SAST: `semgrep scan --config=p/owasp-top-ten --config=p/security-audit --severity ERROR --severity WARNING .` | Fix all critical/high findings | Same |
| Run dependency scan: `snyk test` | Fix vulnerable dependencies | Same |
| Run secret scan: `gitleaks dir . --verbose` | Remove any detected secrets | Same |
| Generate SBOM (CycloneDX or equivalent) | Archive in docs/test-results/ | Same |
| Validate threat model — every vector from Phase 1 has a verified mitigation or documented acceptance | Fix gaps | Same |
| Run chaos/edge-case tests | Verify error recovery and input abuse defenses | Same |
| Run accessibility audit (Lighthouse for web, platform tools for desktop/mobile) | Meet WCAG AA / Lighthouse 90+ | Same |
| Run performance audit | Meet latency targets from data contracts | Same |
| Archive ALL test results in `docs/test-results/` | Named `[date]_[scan-type]_[pass\|fail].[ext]` | Same |
| User testing (Standard+ track): have someone unfamiliar complete the core flow | Document confusion points; fix critical ones | Same |
| **DECISION GATE: Approve go-live** | Self-review; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md | Application Owner + IT Security approve; both recorded in APPROVAL_LOG.md |
| — | — | IT Security reviews scan results |
| — | — | Penetration test (if required by track or org policy) |
| — | — | Legal reviews Privacy Policy (if external users) |

**Interpreting scan results:** See the [Security Scan Interpretation Guide](security-scan-guide.md) for plain-language explanations of common Semgrep and Snyk findings, including how to determine if a finding is real or a false positive.

**Test results archival:** Save ALL scan results to `docs/test-results/` using the naming convention: `[date]_[scan-type]_[pass|fail].[ext]` (e.g., `2026-04-15_semgrep_pass.json`). These are audit evidence for the Phase 3 gate and are referenced in APPROVAL_LOG.md.

**Gate enforcement (not just manual scans):** The scans above are also framework-run and mechanically verified at the Phase 3 → 4 transition — they are not a purely manual step. `scripts/check-phase-gate.sh` auto-invokes `scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh` and blocks the transition unless an aggregate summary (`docs/test-results/phase3/summary-*.md`) shows every registered scanner — `semgrep-full-tree`, `license`, `snyk`, `zap-dast`, `threat-model` (all five real as of BL-070) — as PASS or an **attested skip**. Attest an unavailable tool with `bash scripts/run-phase3-validation.sh --attest <scanner> --reason "<why>"` (recorded to `.claude/phase-state.json::phase3.attestations.<scanner>` — skips are attested, not silenced). The summary is bound to the tree it validated (BL-082), so a stale summary can't satisfy the gate. See the Builder's Guide, "Phase 3 → Phase 4 Gate," for the full contract.

**License compliance is a real gate, not just an inventory (BL-086).** The `license` scanner doesn't only list your dependencies' licenses — it enforces a **deny policy** against strong copyleft (GPL / AGPL / SSPL). On the **corporate track** — an organizational deployment, a Sponsored POC, **or a Private POC** — a denied license **hard-blocks** the Phase 3→4 gate. On a **purely personal** project it PASSES but prints a large, unmissable warning naming each copyleft package and spelling out that if you ever distribute, sell, run it as a commercial service (AGPL triggers on network service alone), or move it onto the corporate track, you must remove the dependency, buy a commercial license, or open-source your own code. LGPL / MPL / EPL and permissive licenses are **not** denied, and a dual license like `MIT OR GPL-3.0` passes (you may elect the safe side). Override the list or exempt a commercially-licensed package via `.claude/license-policy.json`, or record a deliberate exception on a blocked tier with `SOLO_LICENSE_ATTESTED=1 SOLO_LICENSE_REASON="…"` (recorded to `phase3.license_exceptions[]`, never silenced). Full details, including the default deny list and the policy-file schema, are in the [Security Scan Interpretation Guide](security-scan-guide.md#license-compliance--deny-policy).

**Pre-launch preparation (Standard+ track):**

- Have at least one person unfamiliar with the product complete the core user flow. Document where they get confused. Fix critical confusion points.
- Generate user documentation: USER_GUIDE.md for internal tools, in-app help or documentation site for external products. Match scope to complexity — a simple CRUD app needs a one-page guide, not a manual.
- Complete the legal checklist: Privacy Policy (if collecting data), Terms of Service (if applicable), license audit passing in CI, trademark search completed.

**What you produce:** `docs/test-results/` (all scan reports), SBOM, Privacy Policy (if applicable), user documentation, go-live checklist

**Zero critical or high-severity findings before proceeding.** No exceptions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 3 — Remediation Table (click to expand)</strong></summary>

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Logic Drift** | App works but doesn't solve the Phase 0 problem | "Strayed from Manifesto. Remove [Feature X]. Re-align." |
| **Silent Errors** | App fails without user feedback | "Error boundaries. Every failure shows recovery suggestion." |
| **Security Regression** | Change broke auth or data isolation | "Full security audit from 3.2. Non-negotiable." |

### Phase 4: Release & Maintenance (1-3 days + ongoing)

**What happens:** The agent configures deployment, creates monitoring, writes HANDOFF.md, and produces release notes.

| Your Action | Personal | Organizational |
|---|---|---|
| If `poc_mode` is set, run `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --to-production` first (see §1.2). Phase 4 is hard-blocked otherwise at both `check-phase-gate.sh` and `process-checklist.sh --start-phase4`. | Required | Required |
| Verify production build on all target platforms | Same | Same |
| Configure secrets in CI/CD (API keys, signing certs, deployment credentials) | Same | Same |
| Review incident response playbook (INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) | Self-review | Same — share with backup maintainer |
| **DECISION GATE: Go-live smoke test** — walk through the full user journey on each platform in production | Self-review; record in APPROVAL_LOG.md | Same |
| Verify monitoring is active — trigger a test error and confirm you receive an alert | Same | Same |
| Review and publish RELEASE_NOTES.md | Same | Same |
| — | — | File ITSM deployment ticket |
| — | — | Backup maintainer validates HANDOFF.md (can build, test, deploy, run scans from the doc alone) |

**The incident response playbook:**

The agent generates `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` with severity classifications. Review and confirm it matches your operational reality:

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Notification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEV-1** | App unusable, data loss, security incident | Immediate | You + backup maintainer + sponsor + IT Security |
| **SEV-2** | Major feature broken, data integrity concern | Within 1 hour | You + backup maintainer |
| **SEV-3** | Non-critical bug, performance degradation | Within 4 hours | You |
| **SEV-4** | Cosmetic issue, minor bug | Next maintenance window | Log in tracker |

The playbook must include: rollback procedure (platform-specific), data model rollback, containment strategy (SEV-1/SEV-2: rollback first, investigate second), log preservation procedure, and secrets rotation procedure.

**Triggering a release:**

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

The release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs automatically on version tags. Review the TODOs in the release pipeline before your first tag — code signing and deployment secrets must be configured in your CI/CD provider's secrets management.

**Go-live smoke test:** Walk through the complete user journey on EACH target platform in the production environment. Not staging. Production. Trigger a test error and confirm your monitoring captures it and you receive an alert.

**The handoff test (organizational):** Your backup maintainer follows `HANDOFF.md` from scratch — clone, set up development environment, build, run tests, run security scans, execute the deployment procedure. Every gap they find gets fixed in the document. Repeat until they can operate independently.

**What you produce:** `HANDOFF.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`, monitoring configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 4 — Remediation Table (click to expand)</strong></summary>

| Issue | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Build Failure** | CI fails on one or more platforms | "Isolate the platform. Fix on a branch. Full test suite before merging." |
| **Environment Mismatch** | Works in dev, fails in production | "Diff configurations. Check platform-specific settings." |
| **Cost Spike** | Hosting/distribution costs exceed ceiling | "Identify the resource. Optimize or restructure." |
| **Dependency Break** | Update breaks the app | "Revert to last tagged release. Fix on a branch." |
| **Rollback Failure** | Rollback procedure doesn't work | "Fix the runbook first. Broken runbook is higher priority than broken feature." |

</details>

## 6. The Approval Log in Practice

`APPROVAL_LOG.md` is your audit trail. It records every phase gate decision.

### When to Update It

At every phase gate. The agent will prompt you. The gates are:

| Gate | What Is Approved | Personal | Organizational |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 → 1 | Product Manifesto (problem, scope, success criteria) | Self-review | Project Sponsor |
| Phase 1 → 2 | Project Bible (architecture, build plan, risk register) | Self-review | Senior Technical Authority |
| Phase 2 → 3 | Build Loop complete; FRD, test coverage, code review done | Self-review | Senior Technical Authority |
| Phase 3 → 4 | Go-live readiness (security scans, pen test, runbook, rollback) | Self-review | Application Owner + IT Security |
| Phase 4 release | Production cutover (deployment, monitoring, handoff) | Self-review | Application Owner + IT Security |

### What Counts as Evidence

For personal projects, a dated self-review entry is sufficient.

For organizational projects, reference external evidence:

- Email subject line and date ("RE: Invoice Tool Manifesto Approval — 2026-04-10")
- Ticket number ("ITSM-4521 approved 2026-04-10")
- Signed PDF filename
- Meeting minutes reference

### The Rules

1. **Append-only.** Never edit or delete a previous entry. If a decision changes, add a new entry explaining the change.
2. **Every gate, every time.** Even if the approval is "I reviewed this myself and it looks correct."
3. **Be specific.** "Approved" is not enough. "Approved — MVP Cutline includes features 1-5, defers features 6-8 to v1.1" is.

### Example Entry (Organizational)

```
## Phase 0 → Phase 1 Gate
- **Date:** 2026-04-10
- **Gate:** Product Manifesto Approval
- **Approver:** Jane Smith, VP Product
- **Method:** Email
- **Evidence:** "RE: Invoice Tool Manifesto Approval" dated 2026-04-10
- **Decision:** Approved — MVP Cutline includes features 1-5 (invoice upload,
  matching, mismatch flagging, export, dashboard). Features 6-8 (bulk import,
  scheduled runs, Slack notifications) deferred to v1.1.
- **Notes:** Sponsor requested mismatch threshold be configurable (added to
  feature 3 requirements).
```

### Example Entry (Personal)

```
## Phase 0 → Phase 1 Gate
- **Date:** 2026-04-08
- **Gate:** Product Manifesto Approval
- **Approver:** Self
- **Decision:** Approved. MVP Cutline is features 1-4. Reviewed user journeys
  and data contracts — no issues found.
```

### How an Auditor Reads It

Top to bottom, chronologically. They are looking for: Was every gate explicitly approved? By whom? Is there evidence? Are there gaps or backdated entries? The append-only rule exists because auditors notice edits.

For personal projects, maintaining the log is optional but recommended. If your personal project ever becomes an organizational one (it happens), having the history is valuable.

---

## 7. Ongoing Maintenance

After launch, you are the operations team. Schedule these activities.

### Weekly (30 minutes)

- Review error dashboard — are there recurring errors?
- Check monitoring alerts — any unresolved notifications?
- Quick application health check — does the core flow still work?
- When starting a development session: the agent runs `scripts/check-versions.sh` automatically — review the results and update any flagged tools before proceeding
- When starting a development session: run `bash scripts/resume.sh` to generate a context-aware resume prompt from your project's current state

### Monthly (1-2 hours)

- Run dependency audit: `snyk test`
- Apply non-breaking security patches
- Rotate API keys/tokens approaching expiration
- Update SBOM
- Review hosting/infrastructure costs — are you within budget?

### Quarterly (2-3 hours)

- Run the framework validation script: `bash scripts/validate.sh` — checks framework file completeness, approval log currency, CLAUDE.md drift, security tooling, and phase artifact consistency
- Review usage patterns — what are users doing? What are they requesting?
- Performance comparison to last quarter
- Prioritize post-MVP backlog based on real user signals
- Infrastructure cost trend review

### Biannually (3-4 hours)

- Full dependency audit — identify deprecated packages, plan version upgrades
- Re-run Phase 3 security and performance audit
- Verify AI provider terms have not changed in ways that affect compliance
- Review platform requirements (SDK versions, OS support, app store policies)
- Update the solo-orchestrator clone (`cd ~/solo-orchestrator && git pull`) and run `bash scripts/check-updates.sh` from your project to see if framework documents have changed upstream
- **(Organizational)** Insurance/AI terms verification with broker and legal

Expect 2-4 hours/week for the first 3 months post-launch. It stabilizes to 1-2 hours/week (50-80 hours/year per application). Maintenance is bursty — a security advisory can consume a full day, and then nothing happens for two weeks.

**Scaling warning:** At 10 applications, maintenance alone is a half-time job. If you are managing a portfolio, track hours per application. If total maintenance consistently exceeds your available hours, either graduate applications to engineering teams or stop taking new projects.

### Refreshing CDF framework assets

Your project's `.claude/framework/` subtree holds the Development Guardrails (CDF) hooks, rules, and gates — the machinery behind Claude Code's pre-commit checks (config-guard, branch-safety, plan-tracking, test-strategy, and friends). CDF ships these at project creation and continues to land fixes upstream. **Existing projects do not pick up those fixes automatically** — you refresh them by running an upgrade.

**One-time setup:** keep the CDF clone current so there is something to sync from:

```bash
cd ~/.claude-dev-framework && git pull --ff-only
```

(If you do not have the clone: `git clone https://github.com/kraulerson/claude-dev-framework.git ~/.claude-dev-framework`. The default location is `~/.claude-dev-framework`; override with the `CDF_HOME` environment variable if your clone lives elsewhere.)

**Refresh the assets in your project:**

```bash
cd ~/projects/your-project
bash scripts/upgrade-project.sh --backfill-only     # lightest upgrade — syncs CDF only, no track/deployment change
```

`--backfill-only` is the lightest invocation: it refreshes CDF assets (and runs the manifest backfills) without changing your track or deployment. Any full `upgrade-project.sh` run (e.g. `--track`, `--deployment`, `--to-production`) also refreshes CDF assets as part of the upgrade.

What the refresh does:

- Fast-forwards the CDF clone (`git pull --ff-only`), then re-copies its `hooks/`, `rules/`, and `gates/` into your project's `.claude/framework/`, marking hook and gate scripts executable.
- Bumps `.claude/manifest.json`'s `frameworkVersion` and `frameworkCommit` to the clone's current values, so `scripts/check-updates.sh` and the session-start version check report the version now on disk.

**Graceful degradation:** if the CDF clone is missing (or the upgrade runs non-interactively without a clone), the refresh prints a `[WARN]` to stderr, keeps your project's existing `.claude/framework/` assets untouched, and the upgrade completes normally — a missing clone never blocks an upgrade. If the clone's `git pull --ff-only` fails (dirty tree or local commits), the refresh warns and proceeds using the clone's current working tree; resolve the clone's state and re-run to pick up the latest upstream fixes.

**Frequency:** refresh biannually alongside the framework-document check below, or immediately whenever a CDF fix you need lands upstream.

### Keeping your project current: `--sync-framework`

CDF's `--backfill-only` (above) refreshes the *Development Guardrails* assets. A
separate concern is the **solo-orchestrator** side of your project: the vendored
gate scripts (`pre-commit-gate.sh`, `check-phase-gate.sh`, …), the helper libs,
your git hooks, and the framework reference docs. Those are copied in at project
creation and, at your current tier, only refresh as a side effect of a *tier
change*. `scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework` is the same-tier refresh —
it brings a month-old project up to current framework behaviour without changing
your track or deployment.

Run it from **inside your project**, using the **framework clone's** copy of the
script (not your project's vendored copy — the script refuses that, because a
copy syncing onto itself is a no-op):

```bash
cd ~/projects/your-project
# Preview first — computes every change and writes NOTHING:
bash ~/solo-orchestrator/scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework --dry-run
# Then apply:
bash ~/solo-orchestrator/scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework
```

Always run `--dry-run` first. It prints one line per file it *would* change and
touches nothing on disk — no tmp files, no CDF calls, no manifest writes.

**What it syncs (applies for you):**

- **Vendored scripts + helper libs** — every script `init.sh` ships is compared
  to the framework and re-copied when it drifts (file modes mirrored, so
  executables stay executable). One line per *changed* file.
- **Git hooks (ask-first).** The commit-msg TDD gate and the fallback pre-commit
  hook are installed or refreshed **only with your consent**: interactively you
  are prompted per hook; non-interactively nothing is touched unless you pass
  `--install-hooks`. Refreshes replace only the framework-managed marker block —
  anything you added outside it is preserved. A pre-`--sync-framework` hook with
  no marker block is treated as entirely yours: it is never overwritten; a
  `<hook>.new` sidecar is written for you to diff and adopt.
- It also runs the manifest/host **backfills** and the **CDF asset refresh**, and
  stamps `.claude/manifest.json`'s `soloFrameworkCommit` to the framework commit
  you synced from (distinct from CDF's `frameworkCommit`).

**What it only notices (never applies unless you say so):**

- **Framework reference docs** (`docs/reference/*.md`) — you get a drift notice
  with a capped diff. Interactively you are then asked per doc: skip, write a
  `<doc>.new` sidecar, or overwrite in place. **A non-interactive run applies
  nothing by default** — it prints the notice and moves on.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`** are *rendered* from templates for your
  project, so this mode **never** rewrites them — it shows a template-level diff
  (or an upstream-revision count) and points at the assisted-apply follow-up.
  Your customised `CLAUDE.md` is safe, under every flag below. Nothing is written
  *beside* them either: no `.new`, no `.bak`, no template copy — a sync leaves no
  new `CLAUDE.md*` / `PROJECT_INTAKE.md*` file of any kind on disk.

#### Applying doc updates without a prompt: `--apply-doc-updates`

Scripted / CI runs have no one to answer the prompt, so if you want a
non-interactive sync to *act* on drifted reference docs you must say so on the
command line. There is no environment variable and no hidden default:

```bash
# Notice only (this is also what you get with no flag at all):
bash ~/solo-orchestrator/scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework \
  --apply-doc-updates skip

# Write <doc>.new next to each drifted doc; your files are untouched:
bash ~/solo-orchestrator/scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework \
  --apply-doc-updates sidecar

# Replace drifted docs in place — needs the second, destructive-step consent:
bash ~/solo-orchestrator/scripts/upgrade-project.sh --sync-framework \
  --apply-doc-updates overwrite --confirm-doc-overwrite
```

- `--apply-doc-updates <skip|sidecar|overwrite>` — what a **non-interactive** run
  does with a drifted `docs/reference/*.md`. An unknown value is a hard usage
  error. Interactive runs ignore it and ask you per doc, as before.
- `--confirm-doc-overwrite` — the separate consent for the one destructive
  action. `--apply-doc-updates overwrite` **without** it is refused per doc
  ("in-place overwrite NOT confirmed"), and your file is left byte-identical.
  Interactively, the same second confirmation is a `[y/N]` prompt that defaults
  to **no**.
- **Overwrite always backs up first.** A dated `<doc>.bak.<YYYY-MM-DD>` is written
  and verified *before* your file is touched. If that backup cannot be written
  (read-only directory, no space), the sync **refuses to overwrite that doc**,
  leaves it untouched, says so loudly, and exits non-zero. It never overwrites an
  unbacked file.
- **A write that does not land is never reported as success.** Every apply — the
  sidecar copy, the backup, the overwrite itself — is checked *and re-read* from
  disk afterwards. If any of them fails (unwritable file, no space), the sync
  prints a `[FAIL]` line naming the doc and the operation, leaves your original
  bytes intact (restoring them from the dated backup if need be, which is kept),
  keeps going with the *other* docs, and then **exits non-zero**. You will never
  see `[OK]` for a doc that was not actually written.
- **`--non-interactive`** forces this declared-flag channel even on a terminal:
  with it, hooks need `--install-hooks` and doc applies need `--apply-doc-updates`
  — no prompt is shown, and nothing is auto-answered `yes`.
- Both flags are valid **only** with `--sync-framework`, and they apply **only**
  to the seven verbatim `docs/reference/*.md` files. `CLAUDE.md` and
  `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` stay notice-only no matter what you pass — including
  `--apply-doc-updates sidecar`, which writes nothing next to them.

### Governance Health Checks

In addition to application monitoring, track these governance signals:

- **Monthly:** Confirm backup maintainer completed their sync. Log maintenance activities in CHANGELOG.md or ITSM.
- **Quarterly:** Verify credential rotation compliance. Confirm backup maintainer can still access all production systems. Review graduation trigger thresholds.
- **Biannually:** Re-run the full competency matrix. Confirm CI pipeline still includes mandatory tools for all "No" domains.

If any governance check fails, address it before adding new features. See the [Governance Framework](governance-framework.md) for escalation paths.

### When to Graduate

The Solo Orchestrator model has limits. If any of these triggers are met, the application needs a conventional engineering team:

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Active user count | >10,000 |
| Sustained maintenance demand | >4 hours/week for 3+ consecutive months |
| Enterprise system integrations | >3 |
| Business criticality | Designated business-critical by Application Owner |
| Compliance scope change | Application comes under SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or similar |

See the [Governance Framework](governance-framework.md) for the graduation transition plan.

## 8. Evaluation Prompts

The framework ships with two categories of evaluation prompts that provide independent adversarial review from multiple professional perspectives. Framework evaluation prompts assess the methodology and documentation itself. Project evaluation prompts assess any application built using the methodology. No single reviewer catches everything — each perspective has different blind spots, which is why there are six independent reviewers in each category.

### 8.1 Framework Evaluation Prompts

**When to use:** After any framework update, retooling to support a new AI vendor, new platform module addition, or significant documentation change.

**How to run:**

```bash
# From the solo-orchestrator repository root — run all reviews
cd /path/to/solo-orchestrator
chmod +x evaluation-prompts/Framework/run-reviews.sh
./evaluation-prompts/Framework/run-reviews.sh

# Run a single review
claude -p "$(cat evaluation-prompts/Framework/01-senior-engineer-review.md)"
```

Alternatively, paste the prompt file contents into any capable LLM alongside the framework documentation.

| File | Reviewer Perspective | What It Evaluates | Output File |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-senior-engineer-review.md` | Senior Software Engineer (20+ yr) | Architecture, enforcement integrity, cross-platform credibility, real-world viability | `senior-engineer-review-v1.md` |
| `02-cio-review.md` | CIO (startup to Fortune 500) | Total cost of ownership, vendor risk, governance, scalability, strategic positioning | `cio-review-v1.md` |
| `03-security-review.md` | SVP IT Security | Attack surfaces, LLM security boundaries, compliance gaps, enforcement vs. security theater | `security-review-v1.md` |
| `04-legal-review.md` | Corporate Legal / General Counsel | Licensing, AI-generated code IP, regulatory compliance, liability exposure | `legal-review-v1.md` |
| `05-technical-user-review.md` | Technical User (non-coder) | Onboarding experience, usability, documentation quality, personal and enterprise viability | `technical-user-review-v1.md` |
| `06-red-team-evaluation.md` | Red Team Engineer / AppSec Architect | Methodology attack surface, exploitable weaknesses, bypass paths, false sense of security | Inline deliverable (two-part assessment) |

Running all framework prompts after a change and cross-referencing findings across multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) produces the most reliable results.

### 8.2 Project Evaluation Prompts

**When to use:** Phase 3 validation (after the application is functionally complete but before production deployment), after major feature additions, and periodically during maintenance.

**How to run:**

```bash
# From the project root directory — run all 6 reviews for a web app
cd /path/to/your-project
/path/to/evaluation-prompts/Projects/run-reviews.sh web-app

# Run specific reviewers (engineer + security only)
/path/to/evaluation-prompts/Projects/run-reviews.sh web-app 1 3

# Compose a prompt without running it (inspect first)
/path/to/evaluation-prompts/Projects/compose.sh engineer web-app
```

The project review system is modular. Each review combines a **base template** (`bases/` — reviewer persona and universal evaluation categories) with a **domain module** (`modules/` — project-type-specific categories). The `compose.sh` script assembles them into a complete prompt.

**Base templates** (reviewer personas — in `bases/`):

| File | Reviewer Perspective | What It Evaluates | Output File |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bases/01-senior-engineer.md` | Senior Software Engineer (20+ yr) | Architecture, code quality, enforcement, scalability | `senior-engineer-review-v1.md` |
| `bases/02-cio.md` | CIO (startup to Fortune 500) | Total cost of ownership, vendor risk, governance, strategic positioning | `cio-review-v1.md` |
| `bases/03-security.md` | SVP IT Security | Attack surfaces, data protection, compliance, enforcement vs. security theater | `security-review-v1.md` |
| `bases/04-legal.md` | Corporate Legal | Licensing, IP, privacy, regulatory compliance, liability exposure | `legal-review-v1.md` |
| `bases/05-technical-user.md` | Technical User (non-coder) | Onboarding, usability, documentation, personal and enterprise viability | `technical-user-review-v1.md` |
| `bases/06-red-team-review.md` | Red Team Engineer / Offensive Security | Exploitable vulnerabilities, attack chains, proof-of-concept exploits, remediation code | `red-team-review-v1.md` |

**Domain modules** (project-type categories — in `modules/`):

| Module | Use For |
|---|---|
| `modules/web-app.md` | SPAs, full-stack web apps, server-rendered apps, PWAs |
| `modules/desktop-app.md` | Electron, Tauri, native desktop (WPF, SwiftUI, GTK) |
| `modules/mobile-app.md` | iOS native, Android native, cross-platform (React Native, Flutter, KMP) |
| `modules/api-service.md` | REST APIs, GraphQL, gRPC, microservices, serverless |
| `modules/cli-tool.md` | Command-line tools, build tools, automation utilities |
| `modules/framework.md` | Dev frameworks, LLM orchestrators, build systems, compliance tools |
| `modules/mcp_server.md` | MCP servers, AI assistant integrations, tool/resource providers |

**Scripts:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run-reviews.sh` | Orchestrates review execution — composes prompts and runs them via `claude -p` |
| `compose.sh` | Assembles a base template + domain module into a single runnable prompt |

**Recommended workflow:** Run all six reviewers, address all Critical and High findings from every reviewer before deployment, and cross-reference findings across reviewers to identify patterns. A vulnerability flagged by both the security reviewer and the red team reviewer is a confirmed issue.

### 8.3 Interpreting Results

Findings flagged by multiple reviewers are confirmed issues — prioritize these. Findings flagged by only one reviewer should be manually evaluated; they may be valid but lower-confidence, or they may reflect that reviewer's specific blind spot intersecting with a real gap.

Running the same prompt across different AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) increases coverage. Each model has different training data and reasoning patterns, so they catch different issues. This is particularly valuable for the legal and security reviews.

The red team review is the most likely to find issues that automated scanners (SAST, DAST, SCA) miss, because it constructs multi-step attack chains and tests business logic flaws that pattern-matching tools cannot detect.

## Quick Reference — Common Issues

| Issue | Detection Signal | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Context Window Bleed** | AI hallucinates variables, forgets structure | Fresh session with Bible + last 3-4 active files |
| **Code Drift** | Feature works but contradicts the Bible | Stop. Re-inject Bible. Realign before continuing. |
| **Logic Drift** | App works but doesn't solve Phase 0 problem | Re-read Manifesto to AI. Remove non-Manifesto features. |
| **Feature Creep** | AI suggests features outside MVP Cutline | "Not in the Cutline. Not in Phase 2. Post-MVP Backlog." |
| **Dependency Creep** | New package for every small problem | "Achieve with existing stack. Justify any new dependency." |
| **Security Regression** | Change broke auth or data isolation | Re-run Phase 3.2. Non-negotiable. |
| **Rollback Failure** | Procedure doesn't work | Fix runbook first. Higher priority than broken feature. |
| **AI Quality Variance** | Consistently poor output in a session | End session, start fresh. Quality varies across sessions. |
| **Architecture Wrong Mid-Build** | Can't support a requirement | Stop Phase 2. Return to Phase 1.2. Revise Bible. |

## 9. Troubleshooting & FAQ

**"The agent is asking me questions I already answered in the Intake."**

Your Intake is incomplete or vague in that area. Re-read the specific section the agent is asking about. If you wrote "improve efficiency" instead of a concrete problem statement, the agent cannot proceed without clarification. Fix the Intake, then re-provide it.

---

**"The agent wants to add features not in the MVP Cutline."**

Tell it no. Reference the Product Manifesto: "The MVP Cutline is defined in the Manifesto. Do not add features beyond it." If the agent persists, check whether the feature is an implicit dependency of something you did request (e.g., authentication is required for user-specific data but you did not list it).

---

**"A security scan found a Critical finding."**

Fix it before proceeding. Do not skip, defer, or accept risk on Critical findings. The framework has no bypass for this. If the fix requires an architecture change, return to the appropriate phase.

---

**"I can't get approval from IT Security / the sponsor is unavailable."**

You wait. The framework does not have a bypass for organizational approvals. If the delay is long, escalate through the escalation chain defined in Section 8.3 of your Intake. Document the delay in APPROVAL_LOG.md.

---

**"I'm stuck between phases."**

Re-read the Builder's Guide section for the phase you are leaving and the one you are entering. Check the Intake for missing information that may be blocking the gate. Run the phase completion checklist — an unchecked item is likely the blocker.

---

**"The health check shows missing security tools."**

Install them before starting Phase 2. Semgrep, gitleaks, and Snyk are required for the Build Loop security audits. Without them, the per-feature security checks cannot run and findings will accumulate.

```bash
# macOS
brew install semgrep gitleaks
npm install -g snyk

# Linux / WSL
pip install semgrep
# gitleaks: download from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases
npm install -g snyk
```

---

**"My project is too complex for one person."**

If your project needs multiple concurrent developers, microservices, or 99.99%+ SLA, it is outside the framework's current scope. Regulated-industry compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) is a planned extension — the governance structure already provides role-based approval gate separation, but compliance-specific modules have not yet been built. See "What This Is Not (Today)" in the [README](https://github.com/kraulerson/solo-orchestrator#readme).

---

**"The context health check shows the agent has drifted."**

Start a fresh session. Provide the current `PROJECT_BIBLE.md`, the last 3-4 files you were working on, and the message: "We are continuing Phase 2. Here is current state." Do not try to correct a drifted agent in-session — it is faster to restart.

---

**"I want to change the architecture mid-Phase 2."**

This is expensive. The Project Bible is the point of no return for a reason. If the architecture is fundamentally wrong, return to Phase 1, revise the Bible, and get it re-approved. All Phase 2 work built on the old architecture may need to be redone. If the change is minor (swapping a library, adjusting a pattern), document it as an Architecture Decision Record and update the Bible.

---

**"How do I handle a long-running project across many Claude Code sessions?"**

Each session, provide the current `PROJECT_BIBLE.md` as context. The Bible is the single source of truth for the project's architecture, data model, and decisions. If you have configured the Qdrant MCP server, the agent can also access persistent semantic memory from previous sessions. Without Qdrant, the Bible plus the last few active source files is sufficient context for the agent to resume.

---

**"What's the difference between `strict`, `light`, and `no` enforcement?"**

`strict` (the default) installs `.git/hooks/framework-gate.sh` which blocks user-terminal git commits that violate the Build Loop / Phase classifier. `--no-verify` skips that block but the SessionStart out-of-band detector still records the commit to `.claude/bypass-audit.json`, so the audit trail is preserved. `light` removes the local block but keeps the SessionStart audit — user-terminal commits land freely and are recorded. `no` disables both — only the Claude-side audit (BL-029) keeps running. Pick `strict` unless you have a specific operational reason not to; the audit-vs-block tradeoff at the level boundary is what governance frameworks generally call defense in depth. See `init.sh --enforcement-level` and `scripts/reconfigure-project.sh --enforcement-level`.

---

**"Can I downgrade enforcement on an organizational/Production project?"**

No. Baseline §2.5 forces `strict` for organizational projects in Sponsored POC or Production mode. `reconfigure-project.sh --enforcement-level` will refuse the transition (the lib's `validate_transition` checks deployment + poc_mode before any state change). To get to `light` or `no` on an organizational project, you would first need to be in Private POC (the personal-only POC tier) — which the framework does not let you transition to from organizational. The intentional dead-end: organizational projects don't get to opt out of governance.

---

**"The CI pipeline failed on first push."**

Review the error. Common causes: missing secrets in GitHub (API keys, tokens), language version mismatch between your machine and the CI runner, or a dependency that requires authentication. Fix the pipeline before entering the Build Loop — a broken CI pipeline means you have no automated safety net.

---

### CI Security Check Failures

When a CI security check blocks your build:

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Semgrep (SAST)** | Read the finding. If genuine: fix the code. If false positive: add inline suppression (`# nosemgrep: rule-id`) with a justification comment, then re-push. |
| **Dependency audit** | Check if a patched version exists (`npm audit fix`, `pip install --upgrade`, etc.). If no fix is available, evaluate reachability and document a risk acceptance. For organizational projects, get IT Security approval. |
| **License violation** | Find an alternative dependency with a compatible license. Do not override copyleft blocks without Legal review. |
| **Secret detection (gitleaks)** | Remove the secret from code. Rotate the exposed credential immediately. Use environment variables or a secrets manager instead. |

**Never** disable CI, commit directly to main, or use `--no-verify` to bypass security checks. If genuinely blocked, ask a security-knowledgeable peer for review. (On `strict` projects, every `--no-verify` commit is recorded to `.claude/bypass-audit.json` by the SessionStart detector — the bypass is allowed at commit time but lands in the W7 successor-handoff audit. A reviewer reading the project's history will see it.)

---

**"I'm an organizational user. Can I start Phase 0 while the pre-conditions are 'in progress'?"**

No. The Governance Framework requires all 6 pre-conditions to be resolved — not "in progress" — before Phase 0 begins. If approvals are taking time, use the waiting period to refine your Intake. A more detailed Intake produces better output in Phase 0.

---

**"How do I know which Platform Module to use?"**

Pick the primary surface where users interact with your application. If it is a website or web app, use Web. If it is a native application installed on Windows/macOS/Linux, use Desktop. If it is distributed through app stores or installed on phones/tablets, use Mobile. If it is a command-line tool, no Platform Module is needed — the core Builder's Guide works standalone for CLI projects.

---

**"What if I need features from multiple Platform Modules?"**

Pick the primary platform and use its module. Cross-platform concerns (e.g., a web app with a companion mobile app) are addressed in the architecture selection step of Phase 1, where the agent considers your target platforms from the Intake. You can reference multiple Platform Modules during Phase 1, but the project tracks one primary module.

---

## Quick Reference: What You Produce at Each Phase

| Phase | Key Output Files | Decision Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-Phase 0 | Completed `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`, `APPROVAL_LOG.md` (organizational pre-conditions) | Intake checklist passes |
| Phase 0 | `PRODUCT_MANIFESTO.md` | Approve Manifesto |
| Phase 1 | `PROJECT_BIBLE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, Architecture Decision Records | Approve Bible |
| Phase 2 | Working codebase, test suite, `CHANGELOG.md`, interface docs, ADRs | All features built, all checks pass |
| Phase 3 | `docs/test-results/*`, SBOM, Privacy Policy (if applicable), user documentation | Approve go-live |
| Phase 4 | `HANDOFF.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`, monitoring config | Go-live smoke test passes |

## Document Revision History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5 | 2026-08-01 | Prerequisite-honesty audit: added jq and Git host CLI (`gh`/`glab`/Bitbucket credentials) rows to the Personal Project Prerequisites table (1.1), cross-referenced from the Organizational table (1.2) via "same as personal". |
| 1.4 | 2026-08-01 | Session Start: corrected the claim that the agent acts on `CLAUDE.md` when the session opens — context is loaded at startup but not acted on until the first message, which is the dead-air this section now names; added `scripts/resume.sh` to the session-start commands and the blank-screen reassurance. The Initialization Prompt: noted that `scripts/resume.sh` prints the Intake Section 13 prompt verbatim, so it need not be found and copied by hand (the manual path is retained). |
| 1.3 | 2026-04-10 | Added MCP Server platform to domain modules table, Extending Platforms Guide to document map, updated platform selection guidance. |
| 1.2 | 2026-04-08 | Added Process Enforcement Details subsection (7 items) and POC Mode Lifecycle subsection (4 items) to close UAT documentation gaps. |
| 1.1 | 2026-04-02 | Added evaluation prompts documentation (framework and project review prompts). |
| 1.0 | 2026-04-02 | Initial release. |
