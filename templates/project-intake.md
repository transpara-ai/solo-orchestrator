# Solo Orchestrator — Project Intake Template

## Version 1.0

---

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Document ID** | SOI-004-INTAKE |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Classification** | Project Initialization Template |
| **Date** | __DATE__ |
| **Companion Documents** | SOI-002-BUILD v1.0 (Builder's Guide), SOI-003-GOV v1.0 (Enterprise Governance Framework) |

---

## Purpose

This template collects every decision, constraint, and context variable that the AI agent needs to execute the Solo Orchestrator methodology with maximum autonomy. Fill it out completely before starting Phase 0. Incomplete sections will force the agent to stop and ask — every blank field is a round-trip.

### How This Document Flows Into the Process

The Intake is the primary input to the Builder's Guide. Here's where each section goes:

| Intake Section | Consumed By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Project Identity** | Phase 0 initialization, Platform Module selection | Names the project, sets the track, identifies which Platform Module the agent loads |
| **2. Business Context** | Phase 0 Steps 0.1-0.2 | The agent validates and expands this into the FRD and User Journey — it doesn't re-discover it |
| **3. Constraints** | Phase 0 and Phase 1 | Timeline, budget, and user targets constrain architecture and scope |
| **4. Features & Requirements** | Phase 0 Steps 0.1, 0.4 | The agent expands logic triggers and failure states, flags gaps, produces the Manifesto |
| **5. Data & Integrations** | Phase 0 Step 0.3, Phase 1 Step 1.4 | Drives the Data Contract, data model design, and third-party integration architecture |
| **6. Technical Preferences** | Phase 1 Steps 1.2-1.6 | Hard constraints and preferences feed directly into architecture proposals; Competency Matrix determines where automated tooling is mandatory |
| **7. Revenue Model** | Phase 0 Step 0.5, Phase 1 Step 1.2 | Hosting/distribution cost ceiling constrains architecture; pricing model shapes feature decisions |
| **8. Governance Pre-Flight** | Enterprise Governance Framework pre-conditions | Maps directly to the organizational approvals required before Phase 0 can begin |
| **9. Accessibility & UX** | Phase 1 Step 1.5, Phase 3 Step 3.4 | Architectural constraints from Day 1, not Phase 3 afterthoughts |
| **10. Distribution & Operations** | Phase 4, Platform Module | Distribution channels, monitoring, update strategy — platform-dependent |
| **11. Known Risks** | Phase 1 Step 1.3 | Additional inputs for the Iron Logic Stress Test |

The more complete the Intake, the more autonomously the agent can work. Where the Intake is vague or incomplete, the Builder's Guide prompts shift from validation to discovery — the agent will ask targeted questions instead of proposing options it doesn't have enough context to evaluate.

### How to Use This Document

You can fill this out using the **intake wizard** (`bash scripts/intake-wizard.sh`) or by **editing this file directly**. The wizard offers an interactive walkthrough and tracks your progress. Either approach works, but be aware of the difference:

1. Fill out every section. Mark fields N/A where they genuinely don't apply — don't leave blanks.
2. For organizational deployments, complete the Governance Pre-Flight (Section 8) before starting. This section maps to the Enterprise Governance Framework pre-conditions.
3. Once complete, provide this document to the AI agent at the start of Phase 0 with the instruction: "This is the Project Intake. Use it as the primary constraint for all phases. Do not suggest features, architectures, or tooling that contradict it."
4. The agent will use this to generate the Product Manifesto (Phase 0) and Project Bible (Phase 1) without stopping to ask for information that should already be decided.

> **If editing manually:** Section 1 fields (project name, platform, language, track) and Section 8 (governance mode) were used during init to generate your CI pipeline, release pipeline, platform module, and phase gate rules. If you change these fields here, you must also run the reconfigure script to update the generated files:
>
> ```bash
> bash scripts/reconfigure-project.sh --field <field> --old <old_value> --new <new_value>
> ```
>
> Supported fields: `name`, `platform`, `language`. The intake wizard handles this automatically — manual editing does not.
>
> For `track` or `deployment` changes use `scripts/upgrade-project.sh` instead (it enforces the governance pre-conditions; reconfigure-project does not).

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 The Problem

_What specific problem does this solve? Be concrete — not "improve efficiency" but "the finance team spends 6 hours/week manually reconciling invoices from 3 systems into a single spreadsheet."_

```
[Write the problem statement here]
```

### 2.2 Who Has This Problem

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Primary user persona** | _Job title, technical skill level, what they're trying to accomplish_ |
| **Secondary personas** (if any) | |
| **How do they solve this problem today?** | _Spreadsheet, manual process, different tool, they don't_ |
| **What's wrong with the current solution?** | |

### 2.3 Success Criteria

_How will you know this project succeeded? Define measurable outcomes, not feelings._

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|---|---|---|
| _Example: Time spent on weekly reconciliation_ | _Reduced from 6 hours to <1 hour_ | _User self-report after 4 weeks_ |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### 2.4 What This Is NOT

_List 3-5 things that sound related but are explicitly out of scope. This prevents the agent from scope-creeping into adjacent problems._

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1 Must-Have Features (MVP)

_For each feature, define the business logic trigger and the failure state. If you can't articulate "If [condition], the system must [action]" — the feature isn't defined well enough to build._

| # | Feature | Business Logic Trigger | Failure State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | If [condition], the system must [action] and output [result] | What happens when input is invalid, service is unavailable, or user abandons? |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |

### 4.2 Should-Have Features (Post-MVP v1.1)

_Features that enhance the MVP but are not required for first usable release._

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

### 4.3 Will-Not-Have Features (Explicit Exclusions)

_Things that sound related but the agent must NOT build or suggest._

## 5. Data & Integrations

### 5.1 Data Inputs

_What data does the user provide or the system ingest?_

| Input | Data Type | Validation Rules | Sensitivity | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Example: Employee name_ | _Text_ | _2-100 chars, no special chars except hyphen/apostrophe_ | _PII_ | _Yes_ |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Sensitivity classifications:** Public, Internal, Confidential, PII, Financial, Health/Medical, Regulated

#### 5.1.1 Project-Level Data Classification (Phase 1 Gate — tier-crosscheck-6)

The **highest** classification across all rows in §5.1 is the project-level `data_classification`. It is recorded in `.claude/process-state.json::phase1_artifacts` and enforced as a Phase 1→2 hard gate by `scripts/check-phase-gate.sh`. Per docs/governance-framework.md § VII (Mandatory ZDR gate, line 299), projects classified **Internal or higher** must use a ZDR or self-hosted LLM deployment path — `phase1_artifacts.zdr_attested` (or a documented `phase1_artifacts.zdr_attestation_reason` exception) is required before Phase 1→2.

| Field | Value (one of) |
|---|---|
| **Project-level data_classification** | `public` / `internal` / `confidential` / `pii` / `financial` / `health` / `regulated` |
| **ZDR attested (Zero Data Retention or self-hosted LLM)** | `true` / `false` |
| **ZDR attestation reason** _(required when `zdr_attested=false` AND classification > public)_ | _Free text: written exception (e.g. "Customer SOW requires retention, risk accepted by CISO Email TKT-42")_ |

These three fields are captured by `scripts/intake-wizard.sh` Section 5.5, and can be corrected after-the-fact with `scripts/reconfigure-project.sh --field data_classification --new <value>` / `--field zdr_attested --new true|false`.

### 5.2 Data Outputs

_What does the user receive from the system?_

| Output | Format | Latency Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| _Example: Reconciliation report_ | _PDF download_ | _<10 seconds_ |
| | | |
| | | |

### 5.3 Third-Party Integrations

_Every external API or data source the application needs to connect to._

| Service | What Data We Send/Receive | Auth Method | Fallback if Unavailable | Existing Account? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### 5.4 Data Persistence

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **What data must persist across sessions?** | |
| **What data can be ephemeral (browser/device only)?** | |
| **Expected data volume at 12 months** | _Rows, storage size, or "small/medium/large"_ |
| **Data retention requirements** | _Keep forever, X months, regulatory requirement?_ |
| **Backup requirements** | _Daily, real-time, or "whatever the platform default is"_ |

### 8.5 Exit Criteria

| Outcome | Definition | Decision Maker |
|---|---|---|
| **Success** (proceed to scale) | _e.g., "MVP deployed, handoff test passed, actual hours within 20% of estimate"_ | |
| **Conditional** (proceed with modifications) | _e.g., "MVP works but took 2x projected hours — evaluate methodology adjustments"_ | |
| **Failure** (stop) | _e.g., "Quality unacceptable, security findings unresolvable, or Orchestrator unable to evaluate AI output"_ | |

---

## 9. Accessibility & UX Constraints

## 11. Known Risks & Concerns

_Anything the agent should know that doesn't fit elsewhere. Technical debt you're aware of going in, political sensitivities, dependencies on other projects, timing constraints, previous failed attempts at solving this problem, etc._

```
[Write any additional context here]
```

---

## 11.5. Testing & Bug Tracking

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Testing interval** | _Every N features (default: 2). How many features to build before pausing for a UAT testing session._ |
| **Bug tracking tool** | GitHub Issues / Linear / Jira / BUGS.md / Other: ______ |
| **Human tester count** | _Default: 1 (you, the developer). If >1, testers receive a test template per session._ |
| **Beta tester coordination** (if >1 tester) | _How to reach testers (email, Slack, Discord). How they receive builds (TestFlight, staging URL, GitHub pre-release, download link)._ |
| **Bug severity SLAs** (Full UAT level only) | SEV-1: ___h / SEV-2: ___d / SEV-3: ___d _(default: SEV-1 24h, SEV-2 7d, SEV-3 best effort)_ |

> **How this is used:** The agent pauses construction every N features to run a UAT testing session. Agent testers run automated, exploratory, and cross-platform tests in parallel while you test manually. Bugs are compiled, triaged, and fixed before construction resumes. See Steps 2.7-2.9 in the Builder's Guide.

## 12. Tooling Configuration

> This section is auto-populated by `init.sh` based on the tool installation matrix. It records what was installed, what needs manual setup, and what is deferred to later phases. Claude reads this to understand the available tooling environment.
>
> If this section is empty, run `init.sh` or manually populate `.claude/tool-preferences.json`.

## 13. Agent Initialization Prompt

_Once this template is complete, provide it to the AI agent at the start of Phase 0 along with the Builder's Guide. Copy and customize the bracketed sections._

_The Builder's Guide contains dual-path prompts for Phase 0 and Phase 1 — one for Intake-first (validation and expansion) and one for conversational discovery (without Intake). By providing this Intake, you are activating the Intake-first path. The agent will validate, expand, and challenge your inputs rather than discovering them from scratch._

```
You are the AI execution layer for a Solo Orchestrator project. I am the
Orchestrator. I define intent, constraints, and validation. You provide
architecture, code, and documentation within the constraints I set.

ATTACHED:
1. Project Intake Template (this document) — your primary constraint
2. Solo Orchestrator Builder's Guide v1.0 — your process reference
3. Platform Module: [WEB / DESKTOP / MOBILE] — your platform-specific
   reference for architecture, tooling, testing, and distribution

DOCUMENT RELATIONSHIP:
- The Intake is the DATA SOURCE. It contains my decisions, constraints,
  requirements, technical profile, and (if organizational) governance
  pre-conditions.
- The Builder's Guide is the PROCESS. It defines the phases, steps,
  quality gates, and remediation procedures you follow.
- The Platform Module is the PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE. When the
  Builder's Guide shows a ⟁ PLATFORM MODULE callout, reference the
  attached Platform Module for platform-specific instructions.
- Where the Builder's Guide shows "With Intake" prompts, use those.
  They direct you to validate and expand my Intake data rather than
  re-discovering it.

RULES:
- The Project Intake is the governing constraint. Do not suggest features,
  architectures, or tooling that contradict it.
- The Builder's Guide defines the phase-by-phase process. Follow it.
- The Platform Module defines platform-specific implementation. Follow it
  at every ⟁ callout point.
- If the Intake specifies a hard constraint, respect it absolutely.
- If the Intake specifies a preference, you may recommend against it with
  justification, but defer to my decision.
- If the Intake leaves a field as "no preference," make a recommendation
  based on the constraints and explain your reasoning.
- If the Intake leaves a field blank or incomplete, flag it immediately
  and ask for the specific missing information before proceeding past
  the step that requires it.
- For any domain where my Competency Matrix (Section 6.2) says "Partially"
  or "No," default to the most conservative, well-documented option and
  ensure automated validation tooling covers that domain.
- Do not add features not in the MVP Cutline (Section 4.1).
- Do not suggest dependencies without justification.
- Every feature must have tests before implementation.
- Flag any conflict between the Intake constraints and technical feasibility
  immediately — do not silently work around it.

ACCESSIBILITY (from Section 9):
[Copy any specific requirements here, e.g., "Color vision deficiency:
never rely on color alone for meaning. Use shape, position, text labels,
patterns, or icons."]

PROJECT TRACK: [Light / Standard / Full]
PLATFORM: [Web / Desktop / Mobile / Other]
TARGET PLATFORMS: [e.g., Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+]

BEGIN: Execute Phase 0, Step 0.1 using the "With Intake — Validation
Prompt" path from the Builder's Guide. Use Sections 2 and 4 of the
Intake as the primary data source. Generate the Functional Requirements
Document by expanding my business logic triggers and failure states.
Where I've been vague, make it specific and flag for my review. Where
I've been contradictory, identify the contradiction and ask me to resolve
it. Where I've omitted an implicit dependency (e.g., features that
require authentication but I didn't list authentication), flag it as a
recommended addition.
```
